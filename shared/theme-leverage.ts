/**
 * THEME LEVERAGE — find the highest-torque expression of a macro driver, and the
 * one that has not caught up yet.
 *
 * This is an attempt to reverse-engineer the PROCESS behind calls like "HYMC:
 * $10B post-tax NPV against a $1B market cap, and every $100 on gold adds ~$300M
 * to NPV." Read as a stock tip that is unusable. Read as a method it decomposes
 * into four steps, and every one of them is computable:
 *
 *   1. NAME THE DRIVER.        Gold. Bitcoin. Semis. Rates. One series.
 *   2. MEASURE THE LEVERAGE.   Regress each candidate on the driver. Beta IS the
 *                              "every $100 adds $300M" claim, in price terms,
 *                              and it comes out of returns without needing a
 *                              reserve statement or an NPV model.
 *   3. CHECK IT ACTUALLY TRACKS. High beta with low R-squared is not leverage,
 *                              it is an unrelated volatile stock. This is the
 *                              step that separates a levered play from a lottery
 *                              ticket, and it is the one usually skipped.
 *   4. FIND WHAT HAS LAGGED.   Among names that genuinely track, which has NOT
 *                              yet delivered its beta? That residual is the
 *                              setup — the same shape as "MRNA outperformed QQQ
 *                              5x," just pointed the other way.
 *
 * What comes out is not a ticker list copied from someone else. It is the screen
 * that produced theirs, which means it keeps working after their book changes,
 * and it runs on any driver you can name — including ones they are not watching.
 *
 * Deliberately price-only. Fundamentals would sharpen step 2, but requiring them
 * would mean building nothing today, and the price relationship is the part that
 * actually has to hold for the trade to work.
