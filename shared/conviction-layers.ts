/**
 * The conviction layers, as one canonical list.
 *
 * The layer count was previously typed by hand in three places on the landing
 * page and disagreed with itself: the section heading claimed 14, the hero
 * claimed 15, and the chips below the heading showed 6 from an older taxonomy.
 * The engine's own type union listed 15 while emitting 16 — `macro` was being
 * assigned to layers without ever being declared.
 *
 * A number that is asserted in prose drifts the moment the engine changes. This
 * is the single source: the engine's union is built from it, and the marketing
 * copy counts it, so the two cannot disagree again.
