/**
 * DIVERGENCE ENGINE — price and momentum disagreeing, which is the disagreement
 * that precedes turns.
 *
 * Built to reproduce calls of the shape "NQ massive bullish divergence on the
 * hourly": price grinds to a lower low while momentum makes a HIGHER low, so the
 * selling that produced the new low was weaker than the selling that produced
 * the last one. Sellers are running out before buyers are.
 *
 * The reason this belongs in a signal system rather than an indicator panel is
 * that it is one of the few technical patterns that is genuinely LEADING. Almost
 * everything else on a chart — moving averages, breakouts, trend lines — is a
 * restatement of what price has already done. A divergence is a statement about
 * the FORCE behind price, and force changes before direction does.
 *
 * Two things make most divergence code useless, and both are handled here:
 *
 *   PIVOTS, NOT ENDPOINTS. Comparing the last bar to some bar N back finds a
 *   "divergence" on almost any series. Real ones compare confirmed swing lows —
 *   a bar lower than k bars either side of it — so the pattern is anchored to
 *   structure the market actually made.
 *
 *   CONFIRMATION LAG IS REAL AND MUST BE ADMITTED. A pivot cannot be confirmed
 *   until k bars have printed after it, so every divergence is discovered at
 *   least k bars late. Code that ignores this looks clairvoyant in backtest and
 *   loses money live. `barsSincePivot` is reported so the caller can see exactly
 *   how stale the read is.
 *
 * Divergence says pressure is shifting. It does NOT say when, and it does not
 * say how far — a divergence can persist while price keeps going. It belongs
 * with a level and an invalidation, never on its own.
