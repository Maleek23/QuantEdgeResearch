 * TRIGGER OBSERVER
 *
 * The UI refuses to call a setup triggered on price alone — it waits for
 * `executionAudit.state === "triggered"`, on the principle that a plan is not an
 * entry. That principle is right, but NOTHING in the codebase ever wrote that
 * state: the only writer was recordPaperExecution(), which jumps straight to
 * "executed" and only fires on a paper fill. So every published idea sat at
 * "pending trigger" forever while price ran clean through the entry — LLY
 * showing "waiting" with the trigger 1.6% BELOW spot.
 *
 * This closes the gap: it observes the trigger and records when and at what
 * price it was observed. It never invents a fill — "triggered" means the level
 * traded, not that a position exists.

 * HORIZON EXPIRY

 *
 * Measured on the live book, 2026-08-27:
 *   122 open ideas
 *     13 carried entry_valid_until — and ALL 13 had already passed, still open
 *    109 carried no expiry at all
 *     16 were holding_period='day' with an average age of 22 HOURS
 *     19 of 40 distinct symbols had been open longer than 24h, oldest 46h
 *
 * That is why the same names cycle: the scanners keep re-finding setups that
 * were valid two days ago, and nothing retires the originals. The duplicate
 * gate stops the re-publishing; this retires what is already stale.
 *
 * Horizons mirror lib/oracle/signal-geometry.ts → horizonDaysFor, so a card
 * showing "100% of 5d used" and this pass agree by construction rather than by
 * coincidence.
 *
 * Deliberately NON-DESTRUCTIVE: rows are marked expired, never deleted. An
 * expired idea is still a record of what was published and is still needed to
 * score the book honestly — 156 rows already carry that status.
 *
 * Only untriggered/open ideas expire. An idea that has TRIGGERED is a live
 * position in the user's mind; retiring it out from under them because a clock
 * ran out would be worse than leaving it stale.
