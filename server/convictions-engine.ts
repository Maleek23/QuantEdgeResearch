/**
 * CONVICTIONS ENGINE
 * ==================
 * One ranked list, every layer of confluence stacked on every name.
 *
 * This is the "Today's Convictions" backend. It pulls the most recent
 * trade ideas from the database, then layers in:
 *   1. Technical confluence (RSI, MACD, trend, volume) — already on each idea
 *   2. Convergence signals (options flow + news + sentiment + insider) — from convergenceSignalsJson
 *   3. Catalyst flags (earnings, news catalyst, news bias) — from idea fields
 *   4. Market regime (VIX / SPY / sentiment) — from getMarketContext()
 *   5. Geopolitical context (active scenarios, risk level) — from getScenarioMatrix()
 *   6. Fundamentals (P/E, growth, short interest) — from FundamentalDataProvider
 *   7. Sector tailwind — from approved-tickers SECTOR_MAP + sector ETF performance
 *
 * Every layer contributes points to a single conviction score (0-100).
 * Output is sorted descending so the user sees the highest-conviction
 * setups first, with each contributing layer broken out.
 *
 * Performance design:
 *   - Pulls last 24h of ideas (already pre-filtered by quality scanners)
 *   - Caches market context (5min) and geopolitical matrix (10min)
 *   - Skips fundamentals enrichment when symbol count > 30 (rate-limit safety)

 * BAND CUTOFFS — retuned 22 Aug 2026, after the Watchlist Tier layer stopped scoring.
 *
 * The old cutoffs (S=30 / A=22 / B=15) were set when that layer contributed up to
 * 10 points, and the comment said so outright: "S = 30+ (technical + tier +
 * convergence + regime + sector all firing)". With tier removed, the observed
 * maximum across 88 live picks was 29 — S had become mathematically unreachable.
 *
 * Refitted against the real distribution rather than by subtracting 10, because the
 * tier layer never contributed a flat 10: it paid 8 for S-tier names, 5 for A, 4 for
 * mega-caps, 3 for index ETFs, 2 for secondary and 0 for everything else. A uniform
 * shift would have over-corrected most of the board.
 *
 * Anchored to percentiles of that distribution (n=88, max 29, median 12.5):
 *   S = 25  → top ~5%   — elite should be rare enough to mean something
 *   A = 19  → top ~22%
 *   B = 13  → top ~48%
 *   C = the rest
 *
 * ⚠️ Fitted to a WEEKEND snapshot with stale data — several picks were carrying a
 * Freshness penalty of -6 for being ~29h old, and Yahoo was rate-limiting. Live
 * intraday scores should run higher, which would push more names into S than the
 * ~5% intended. Re-measure on a trading day and adjust these three numbers; that is
 * the only edit required, and it is why they are named constants in one place
 * instead of two inline ternaries that had already been duplicated.

  //
  //   1. CIRCULAR. Watchlist tier records that WE like a symbol. Adding a ticker
  //      to the S-tier list raised its conviction score by 8 with no change in
  //      the tape — the engine rewarding its owner's preference and calling the
  //      result confidence. It inflated hardest on exactly the names already
  //      carrying the most bias, which is the worst place to add any.
  //
  //   2. R:R WAS DOUBLE-COUNTED, and gameable. R:R is a property of the PLAN, set
  //      by where the target is put — and targets are not always structural (the
  //      bear-flag scanner still uses `price * (1 - min(bounce*2, 15)/100)`, a
  //      flat percentage). Scoring R:R meant conviction could be raised by moving
  //      the target further away. Confidence should never be a function of an
  //      output we chose ourselves.
  //
  // The tier still SHOWS — knowing a name is S-tier is useful routing information
  // — it just no longer votes. Deleting the layer outright would have hidden that
  // context; zeroing it keeps the fact and removes the vote.
  //
  // ⚠️ Bands were tuned assuming this contributed ("S = 30+ (technical + tier +
  // convergence + regime + sector all firing)"). Every watchlist name now scores
