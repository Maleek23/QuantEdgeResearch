/**
 * DISCOVERY SCANNER — find names nobody added to the list.
 *
 * Every scanner on this platform reads from a curated allowlist, so by
 * construction it can only re-rank names someone already thought of. That is why
 * the entire gold complex produced zero signals until it was added by hand, and
 * why BMNR and ASST were invisible while ASST ran 148% — both had full price
 * history available the whole time. The analysis was never the blocker. The
 * allowlist was.
 *
 * Adding those tickers by hand fixes those tickers and nothing else. The general
 * problem is that discovery has to start OUTSIDE the list, so this pulls
 * candidates from broad market screeners, drops anything already covered, and
 * makes the rest earn their way in through the same engines everything else is
 * judged by.
 *
 * The gate matters as much as the screen. A microcap that doubled on no volume
 * is not an opportunity for an options platform — there is no chain to trade and
 * no liquidity to get out through. So candidates clear price, volume and dollar-
 * volume floors BEFORE any clever analysis runs, because clever analysis on an
 * untradeable name is a waste of a scan and, worse, produces a signal that looks
 * actionable and is not.
 *
 * Nothing here auto-adds anything. It produces a ranked promotion list with the
 * evidence attached, and a human decides. A screen that silently rewrites its own
 * universe is a screen that cannot be audited.
