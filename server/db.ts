 * `pg` defaults to max 10, and this single pool serves THREE consumers at once:
 * ordinary request handlers, the connect-pg-simple session store (which shares
 * this pool deliberately — see replitAuth.getSession), and eight scheduled
 * background jobs. Under one user that is invisible. With several people on the
 * site at the same time, a scanner sweep can hold every client and normal page
 * requests queue behind it until they time out — which presents as the site
 * being down, not as a pool limit.
 *
 * DB_POOL_MAX lets the deployment match its provider's ceiling. The default of
 * 12 sits under Supabase's pooler cap of 15 with headroom for the one extra
 * connection the scheduler leader-lock holds open (see scheduler-lock.ts).
 *
 * Timeouts matter as much as the count: without them a wedged query holds its
 * client forever and the pool never recovers on its own.
