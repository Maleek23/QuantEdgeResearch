/**
 * BOT-HELD POSITIONS AS COCKPIT PICKS
 * ===================================
 * Anything the bot actually bought appears on the board. Unconditionally.
 *
 * WHY
 * The cockpit reads /api/convictions, which reads `trade_ideas` and then
 * applies the entry gauntlet: holding-period age cap, live revalidation,
 * minScore, short discipline. The bot's real positions live in
 * `paper_positions`. Nothing joined the two.
 *
 * The result, measured 2026-08-31: the bot held 11 open positions and the
 * cockpit displayed 4 of them. Seven were invisible for two different reasons —
 * COPX, DKS and QCOM had no `trade_ideas` row at all, and JNJ, NET, PATH and
 * WDC had rows that the entry filters removed.
 *
 * The second reason is the design error. A position you already OWN is being
 * re-judged by the rules for OPENING one, so it vanishes from the screen the
 * moment it stops looking like a fresh entry — which is often the moment it
 * starts moving. NET was up $1,650, the single best position in the book, and
 * could not be seen.
 *
 * Held is held. These bypass every entry filter by construction: they are not
 * candidates, they are inventory, and the operator needs them on the screen to
 * manage them.

     * NULL rather than filled with premium. A missing level renders as unknown;
