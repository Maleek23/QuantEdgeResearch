## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Personalization is reachable.** The `user_preferences` table, provider and endpoints
  already existed and were entirely unexposed — every user saw an identical, un-tunable
  terminal. Added a Settings panel in the Terminal chrome (account size, max risk per trade,
  options budget, asset types, holding horizon, default view, density, animations).
- **Position sizing per signal** — each signal now says what it means for *your* account:
  share count, dollars at risk, reward at T1, position cost and % of account, sized from
  your own risk settings. Change risk 1% → 2% and every signal re-sizes.
- **Dynamic scan universe** — the scanner no longer only looks at a static approved list.
  Every universe rebuild now absorbs the day's movers (most-active / gainers / losers /
  trending) via the existing Yahoo screener discovery, so names that weren't on anyone's
  list that morning still get scored. Universe went 162 → 281 live, and MRNA (+177% on the
  most-active tape) is now in-scope rather than noticed after the fact.
- **Chart workspace** — every chart has an expand control that opens it full-size over a
  blurred backdrop (Esc / click-out to close, keyboard timeframes preserved).
- **Sector leadership engine** (`/api/sector-leadership`) — ranks every sector across the
  162-name universe by a composite of typical move + breadth + standout gap, and surfaces
  **the leading and lagging names inside each group** (the step rotation leaves out: knowing
  biotech is bid doesn't tell you which biotech to buy). Also tracks the mega-cap group and
  market-wide top movers. Uses the **median** name as the group's move, with an explicit
  skew flag when one outlier is carrying the sector.
- **Trading colour semantics** (`lib/oracle/trading-colors.ts`) — colour is data, so each
  gets one job: green/red for **direction and P&L only**, amber for waiting/caution, cyan
  for structural info, muted for inert. Non-directional health bars (validity, pace) moved
  off green/red — a strong **bearish** setup was rendering green and reading as bullish.
- **Rating deltas with arrows** — conviction scores move, so signal cards and the
  Confidence Index now show ▲/▼ with the point change. Backed by an observed-score tracker
  rather than invented history; the tooltip states exactly what the delta measures.
- **Alert-stream cards rebuilt as live positions** — direction, live P&L, days held,
  lifecycle status, a T1 progress bar, a hold/horizon bar, and drawdown.
- **NEW / BEST / CONVICTION** stream filter (BEST = furthest toward T1) plus a
  **CLOSED TODAY** section for signals that hit target or stopped out.
- **Per-asset-class regime** on the Oracle orb — equities, bonds, dollar, metals and crypto
  each read separately with a bull/bear tally, instead of one SPY number standing in for
  "the market".
- **Oracle signal geometry engine** (`lib/oracle/signal-geometry.ts`) — one pure module that
  derives everything the signal view shows: R-multiples, **T2** (a second target at 2× the T1
  R-multiple — we never had one), progress entry→T1, pace vs horizon spent, drawdown, status
  (PENDING TRIGGER / IN PLAY / AT TARGET / NEAR STOP / INVALIDATED), the VALIDITY / PROGRESS /
  PACE / OVERLAY sub-scores, and the scale-out plan. Validated against the reference terminal:
  risk \$33.00, reward \$37.00, R:R 1.12, PENDING TRIGGER, −2.30% P&L, T1 +11.99%·1.4R,
  STOP −6.24%·0.7R — all exact matches.
- **Oracle panels rebuilt on it** — Price Ladder now carries T2 and R-away per rung; new
  Trade Geometry, Risk/Reward (with dollar risk + reward per share) and Profit Taking Plan
  panels; every panel reads one shared live price so the numbers can't disagree.
- **Terminal (`/t`)** — one shell, five tabs (Oracle · Flow · Heatmap · GEX · PRISM) with a
  shared motion system, sliding tab underline, live uptime, wired to the real engines.
- Oracle Orb (market-regime centerpiece) and Rotation Map (RRG) components.
- Oracle **signal-detail widgets** — Price Ladder (stop/entry/live/target with %/$/away),
  Confidence Index bars (Conviction/Progress/R:R/Structure), and a Context panel with a
  "what to do now" line — all derived from real ConvictionPick data. Wired into the cockpit.
- `/t` is now **full-bleed, no sidebar** (top-nav only, ADR-0001).
- **Universal chart** (ADR-0002) — one `EpochChart` on lightweight-charts v5: real OHLC for
  **any ticker** via `/api/historical-prices` (5m/15m/1h/1D), a flash-UI TF switcher (keys 1–4),
  live OHLC readout, **epoch-anchored trendlines that survive timeframe switches**, and
  horizontal price levels (entry/stop/target). **Embedded in the Terminal Oracle cockpit**,
  replacing the bespoke per-page chart — it's *part of the platform*, not a separate page.
  The `/chartlab` POC route + file were removed once the chart landed in-platform.
- **GEX rankings feed PRISM** — the ranked board (dealer-positioning scan, 39 tickers with
  play score and ±γ polarity) now sits beside the surface: pick a ranked name and PRISM
  loads it. PRISM defaults to the top-ranked play rather than a hardcoded ticker, with SPY
  pinned as the explicit benchmark read.
- **PRISM rebuilt to the desk spec** — the strike × expiry gamma surface (green calls /
  red puts, brighter = more exposure) driven by the shared ticker and defaulting to SPY as
  the market benchmark, with an interpreting panel: spot, net GEX, call wall, put support,
  call-vs-put share, a positive/negative-gamma sentence, the strongest node above and below
  spot, and a "time is your best friend" nudge when that node is near-dated.
- **Terminal utility cluster** — a ticker search in the Terminal chrome that sets the
  shared stock context (search once, every tab follows it, per the desk workflow), an
  active-ticker chip, and a **per-tab GUIDE drawer** (Oracle/Flow/Heatmap/GEX/PRISM) whose
  content is the real workflow: what the tab answers, how to read it, and what it hands to next.
- **Terminal sizing** — bounded the tab content (`max-w-[1600px]`) and capped the Rotation
  Map square so the layout no longer explodes on ultrawide monitors.
- Canonical docs set in `docs/` (Architecture, Onboarding, Runbook, Team) + ADR process + this changelog.
- Cash-secured-put income screener, catalyst research endpoints, cash-gate grade dampening.

### Changed
- Options win-rate now reports **honest realized contract P&L** (was a fabricated ~99.7%).
- Grades display convictionScore-first (single source of truth for score↔grade).

### Fixed
- **Yahoo rate-limit storm broke charts.** `/api/historical-prices` was returning 500 under
  load (the "NO DATA" chart). New `provider-cache.ts` coalesces concurrent callers for the
  same key into one upstream request, caches briefly, and serves stale rather than nothing
  when a provider throttles. Chart endpoint: 500 → 200 in 1.5s, then 1.4ms cached.
- **Per-asset-class regime was 2/5 blank.** BONDS/DOLLAR/METALS came through the batch-quote
  service, which silently dropped them when providers throttled. They now ride the same
  chart sweep as extended hours — all five classes resolve.
- **Extended hours was an orphan endpoint** — built but wired into nothing. It now drives the
  Oracle orb (live session badge + pre/post movers + asset-class regime) and the Rotation
  Map (which now says which session it's showing and when it refreshes, instead of just
  "stale").
- **Unreadable type.** 46 instances of 8–9px text and 52 of muted text at ≤55% opacity —
  genuinely illegible on a dark ground. Applied a readability floor across the Terminal:
  nothing below 10px, muted text no fainter than 70%.
- **Provider rate-limit storm (partial).** Boot scanners were requesting the same symbol
  from several call sites simultaneously — logs showed PLTR fetched 4× and 429'd 3× within
  one second — which starved unrelated endpoints and made the app look like it hung. The
  CBOE fetcher now coalesces concurrent callers into one request with a 60s TTL cache
  (verified: 6 concurrent calls → 1 request, repeat 0ms). **Yahoo still needs the same
  treatment** — it currently 500s `/api/historical-prices` under load, which is why charts
  intermittently show NO DATA.
- **Extended-hours blindness.** New `/api/extended-hours` reads the pre/post tape via
  Yahoo's `includePrePost`, ranking gainers/losers/most-active and reporting the live
  session (pre / regular / post / closed) — the window the platform previously ignored.
- **`GET /api/preferences` 404'd for anyone without a saved row** — the normal first-run
  state — so the settings UI could never load. It now creates defaults instead.
- Settings save used a raw `fetch` and was rejected by CSRF (403); now goes through
  `apiRequest`.
- **Trade levels were fixed percentages.** Every stock idea used `target = entry × 1.08`
  and `stop = entry × 0.965` — an identical 2.29 R:R for every ticker, volatility ignored
  (8% is a huge move in MRK and noise in MARA), and the stop placed at an arbitrary price
  rather than where the thesis is wrong. New `level-engine.ts` derives them from the chart:
  stop beyond the nearest **recent** swing padded by ATR, T1 at the next real swing (never
  below a 1.5R minimum), T2 at the following level, plus a written rationale for each.
  R:R now varies by name (1.5–3.1 across MRK/MARA/CRCL/NVDA) instead of being constant.
- **The options-flow scan was never scheduled** — it only ran when someone called the API
  by hand, the second reason flow stopped accumulating. Now runs every 15 min during market
  hours (9:45–15:45 ET) in both the worker and the dev process.
- **The old design kept loading** because `/p` `/h` `/g` still rendered the legacy shells, so
  a bookmark or open tab never redirected. They now redirect into the Terminal, and the
  Terminal tab is deep-linkable via `?tab=`.
- **Options-flow ingestion was dead since Feb 2026.** `fetchOptionsChain` was Tradier-only,
  and the unfunded key returns 401 — so the FLOW tab (the hero product) silently stopped
  collecting. Now falls back to CBOE, which needs no key. A live scan produces 217 prints.
- **The CBOE fallback itself was broken** (so every Tradier fallback, GEX included, was dead):
  CBOE moved the underlying quote fields up one level (`data.quote.*` → `data.*`), and ships
  contract details only inside the OCC symbol — no `strike` / `expiration_date` / `option_type`
  fields, and `last_trade_price` not `last_sale_price`. Added `parseOccSymbol()` and made the
  quote parsing accept both shapes. NVDA now returns 795 contracts w/ spot $218.85.
- **`underlying_price` was never persisted** on flow rows (0 of 2,462) — so % out-of-the-money
  could never be computed. The scanner now captures spot from the chain and stores it.
- Duplicate `start:worker` script in package.json.
- News rate-limit honesty (`data.Information` now counted); idea dedup defaults.

### Known issues
- `/t` renders inside the legacy sidebar (double chrome) — full-bleed top-nav is next (ADR-0001).
- Grades are not yet calibrated (needs weeks of instrumented outcomes → reweight).
- Root has ~40 superseded `.md` files pending a sweep into `docs/archive/`.
