/**
 * SIGNAL TIMING — when a signal actually fired, and whether that moment was tradeable.
 *
 * Motivating bug: DHR was published at 4:00:57 PM ET — 57 seconds AFTER the close.
 * The board rendered it identically to a signal fired at 10am, so it read as
 * actionable when in reality the next chance to act was ~17.5 hours later, after
 * a full overnight gap. A signal you cannot act on is not the same as a signal
 * you have not acted on yet, and the UI has to say which one it is.
 *
 * Two independent facts, deliberately kept apart:
 *   1. WHICH SESSION it fired in  — was there liquidity at the moment of the call?
 *   2. HOW MANY SESSIONS AGO      — has price had time to leave the entry behind?
 * A signal can be born untradeable (fired at 4:00pm) and still be perfectly fresh.
