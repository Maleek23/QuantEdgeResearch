/**
 * GAMMA SURFACE — the strike × expiry × gamma surface, rendered as a surface.
 *
 * `/api/gex-vex/terminal/:symbol` returns `strikeExpiryMatrix`: a few thousand
 * points of `{ strike, dte, expiryLabel, netGEX, netVEX }`. That is three
 * dimensions of data, and the app has been showing it as 2D slices. This renders
 * the object itself.
 *
 * This is not decoration. Traders already call this the gamma surface; the shape
 * of it — where it humps, where it inverts across expiries — is the read. 3D here
 * is the correct projection of the data, which is the only reason to reach for it.
 *
 * Three decisions worth knowing about:
 *
 * 1. THE DEPTH AXIS IS EXPIRY ORDINAL, NOT DAYS. Measured on SPY the DTE values
 *    run 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13 … 664, 846. Mapping days linearly would crush every
 *    near-term expiry — where essentially all the gamma is — into a sliver and
 *    hand most of the axis to LEAPS nobody is hedging against today. Each expiry
 *    gets equal depth and the axis is labelled with real dates, so it reads as a
 *    term structure rather than as a timeline. It is labelled that way too.
 *
 * 2. MISSING CELLS ARE ZERO, NOT INTERPOLATED. The grid is sparse — 3,094 of a
 *    possible 6,409 cells on SPY — because not every strike lists at every expiry.
 *    A strike with no contracts carries no dealer gamma, so zero is the true value.
 *    Interpolating would invent a surface between strikes that do not exist.
 *
 * 3. COLOUR FOLLOWS THE EXISTING ENCODING. Positive net GEX is call-dominated
 *    structure and takes moss; negative is put-dominated and takes clay — the same
 *    pairing prism-board already uses for its call wall and put support. Cyan stays
 *    structural: spot, axes, grid.
 *
 * ── two things the solid surface cannot say, and the modes that say them ──
 *
 * 4. POINTS MODE DRAWS ONLY LISTED CELLS. Decision (2) is right — an unlisted
 *    strike carries no dealer gamma, so zero is the true value — but it leaves the
 *    mesh unable to distinguish "the chain listed this strike and gamma is flat"
 *    from "the chain never listed this strike at all". Both sit on the zero plane
 *    and shade identically. On SPY that is 3,315 of 6,409 cells rendered as
 *    measurements that were never taken. The hover readout already draws the
 *    distinction ("not listed"); points mode draws it for the whole grid at once,
 *    by dropping absent cells instead of flattening them. This is the same
 *    value/zero/missing separation canon/value.tsx enforces on numbers, applied to
 *    geometry.
 *
 *    Points carry a lifted colour floor. The mesh lerps from near-black and relies
 *    on lighting for form; a bare point at that floor is invisible on a dark
 *    canvas, which would defeat the one job this mode has. Presence is always
 *    legible, and magnitude still drives the hue.
 *
 * 5. OVERFLOW TICKS MARK CLIPPED CELLS. robustMax scales to the 98.5th percentile,
 *    so roughly 1.5% of cells exceed the plotted height and are flattened to ±H.
 *    Nothing said so. A reader saw a plateau and read "several strikes carrying
 *    equal gamma" when one of them was several times the others — exactly the
 *    outlier the robust scale exists to stop from crushing everything else. Each
 *    clipped cell now carries a short tick continuing past the ceiling: the
 *    standard convention for "this runs off the scale", and it costs no new colour.
 *
 *    An earlier plan here was bloom, borrowed from a reference terminal. It was
 *    wrong for this palette. Bloom keys off luminance, and moss/clay are muted
 *    mid-tones — at a sane threshold it would not fire at all, and at a threshold
 *    low enough to fire it would wash out the saturation ramp that encodes
 *    magnitude. It was standing in for "this value exceeds what you can see", so
 *    that is what got built instead, stated directly.
