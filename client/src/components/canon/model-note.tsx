/**
 * CANON · MODEL NOTE
 *
 * Separates what was MEASURED from what was ASSUMED, on any surface whose output
 * depends on a model the data cannot verify.
 *
 * The pattern already exists in two places and nowhere else: the Flow header
 * ("Direction is NOT measured on this feed…") and the Prism read ("Dealer sign
 * is an assumption, not an observation"). Both were written because a directional
 * inference was rendering as though it were an observation.
 *
 * The rule this encodes is worth stating plainly: state which half of your output
 * is inference. Gamma magnitude at a strike is measured from open interest and is
 * solid; the dealer's SIGN is a model. Flow premium is measured; the direction of
 * that premium is not. Showing both with equal confidence is the failure.
