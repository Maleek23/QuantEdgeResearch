/**
 * CANON · VALUE
 *
 * Zero, missing and not-measurable are three different truths and this terminal
 * renders them identically in places. That is a correctness bug wearing a design
 * costume: on a trading screen, "0.0%" and "we don't know" lead to opposite
 * decisions, and a blank cell reads as neither.
 *
 * The distinction matters most where it already bit us. The Flow tab reported
 * bullish-vs-bearish premium that was really call-vs-put premium, because an
 * unmeasured direction was rendered the same as a measured one. Flow now models
 * this properly — NOT MEASURED slots, · UNVERIFIED rows, a "direction measured %"
 * stat. This promotes that pattern rather than reinventing it.
 *
 * Four states, deliberately:
 *
 *   value        a real measurement            renders the number
 *   zero         genuinely zero                renders 0, styled as a real value
 *   missing      we have no data yet           renders — , muted
 *   unmeasurable we CANNOT know from this feed renders NOT MEASURED, italic
 *
 * `missing` and `unmeasurable` are not synonyms. Missing is a gap that better
 * plumbing could fill. Unmeasurable is a statement about the data source, and it
 * does not go away by waiting — a chain snapshot will never tell you who was
 * aggressive. Collapsing them hides which problem you have.
