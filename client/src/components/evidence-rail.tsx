/**
 * EVIDENCE RAIL — the bridge from a signal to the evidence for it.
 *
 * The gap this closes: the Terminal is organised by DATA SOURCE (Oracle / Flow /
 * GEX / Catalyst) while a trader works in STAGES (discover → validate → size →
 * execute). Discovery lives in Oracle, but validation lived in sibling tabs — so
 * checking a signal meant leaving the signal, opening another tab, and typing the
 * ticker in again. The evidence was a peer of the signal instead of a child of it.
 *
 * Research (`/r/:symbol`) already holds the per-ticker evidence, correctly
 * consolidated. What was missing was the door: one link to the chart tab, from one
 * screen. This is that door, widened — every evidence surface, already bound to
 * the symbol you were looking at.
 *
 * Deliberately a component and not a copied JSX block: a symbol appears in the
 * signal card, the watchlist, the rotation map and the flow board, and each of
 * those growing its own set of links is how "GEX" ends up meaning two different
 * things in two places. One rail, one set of destinations.
