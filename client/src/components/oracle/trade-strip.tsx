/**
 * TRADE STRIP — the contract you would actually buy, in the hero.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE TWO PROBLEMS THIS SOLVES
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 1 · POSITION. Measured in the cockpit's centre column:
 *
 *        hero (identity · price · chart · ladder)     0 → 1178px
 *        CONTRACT ENGINE                           1190 → 2171px
 *
 *    The engine is not bloat — it is a real decision surface carrying three
 *    fully-specified contracts across risk tiers, with greeks, liquidity and
 *    projected ROI on each. It deserves its 981px. What it did not deserve was
 *    starting 1,190px down, so the single most actionable fact on the page —
 *    what to buy — required scrolling past the entire chart block.
 *
 * 2 · DISAGREEMENT, which is the more serious one. The hero header printed the
 *    strike stored on the published idea:
 *
 *        header               "Healthcare · CALL $370"
 *        contract engine REC  "$415C · Sep 18 · 26DTE · $22.55"
 *
 *    Those are different trades. `selected.strikePrice` is what the generator
 *    chose when the idea was written; the engine re-selects live against the
 *    current chain through POST /api/options/select. The engine is the
 *    authoritative answer — and the stale one was the one above the fold.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IT DOES ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * It says so. When the live pick differs from the published strike, the strip
 * names both and marks which one the levels were computed from — because the
 * published strike is not garbage, it is the basis of the thesis, the R:R and
 * every number in the Risk panel. Quietly swapping one for the other would hide
 * a real disagreement between two parts of the system; showing only the stale
 * one is what the board did before.
 *
 * This strip is a POINTER, not a replacement. It carries the four facts you need
 * to know whether to keep reading — strike, expiry, premium, ROI — and nothing
 * else. The greeks, the liquidity read, the tier comparison and the value panel
 * all stay in the engine below, which is where a decision between three
 * contracts actually gets made.
