That’s a great and nuanced question — and one that most pros in quant trading spend their entire careers refining. The short answer is:
➡️ No single method guarantees accuracy, but certain quantitative frameworks consistently outperform random chance (e.g. 50–70% win rates) when applied correctly with proper risk control and data engineering.

Let’s break it down by category:

⸻

🧠 1. Statistical / Econometric Methods

These are classical quant approaches that use relationships between variables.

✅ Proven techniques:
	•	Mean Reversion Models
	•	e.g. Pairs Trading, Kalman Filters, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes.
	•	Works best in range-bound or sideways markets.
	•	Typical hit rate: 55–70% (if cointegration and spreads are stable).
	•	Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, GARCH, VAR)
	•	Used to predict returns, volatility, or correlations.
	•	GARCH models in particular are useful for volatility prediction.
	•	Accuracy often ~55–60% for direction prediction, higher for volatility clustering.
	•	Factor Models / Cross-Sectional Alphas
	•	e.g. Fama-French, Barra factors, Momentum, Quality, Value, Size.
	•	Combining factors into a composite score (quant rank models) can yield 60–65% win rates.

📊 2. Machine Learning–Driven Methods

These became dominant for pattern detection and nonlinear relationships.

✅ Common high-performing ones:
	•	Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
→ Excellent for structured tabular data (price features, indicators).
→ Often yield 55–65% accuracy when features are engineered properly.
	•	Random Forests & Ensemble Models
→ Robust, less overfitting, interpretable variable importance.
	•	LSTM / GRU (Recurrent Neural Nets)
→ Capture temporal dependencies in sequential data (like minute or daily bars).
→ Can reach 60–70% directional accuracy in liquid markets, with careful feature scaling and regularization.
	•	Transformer-based Financial Models (FinBERT, Temporal Fusion Transformer)
→ Used to fuse text sentiment + price data for edge prediction (news-driven trades).

⸻

💹 3. Quantitative Pattern & Regime Methods

These focus on market structure, volatility regimes, or meta patterns.
	•	Hidden Markov Models / Regime Switching
	•	Detects when market changes from “trending” to “mean-reverting.”
	•	Allows switching between strategies dynamically.
	•	Volatility & Liquidity Regime Modeling
	•	e.g. low-volatility momentum vs. high-volatility breakout filters.
	•	Improves consistency and Sharpe ratio.
	•	Clustering & PCA
	•	Used to detect latent factors, asset groups, or shifts in correlation structure.

🧭 4. Hybrid / Ensemble Approaches

This is what most successful quant funds use.
For instance:
	•	A meta-model that combines signals from ML + statistical + sentiment features.
	•	Weighted voting ensemble (each sub-model votes bullish/bearish).
	•	Reinforcement learning for portfolio-level decision optimization.

That’s how firms like Two Sigma, QRT, DE Shaw, Renaissance, etc. smooth out errors — no single model runs alone.

🧰 5. Practical Additions That Improve Accuracy

Even if your model’s raw hit rate is only 55%, you can trade profitably with:
	•	Tight risk controls (cut losers fast, let winners run).
	•	Kelly or fractional position sizing (optimal leverage).
	•	Signal filtering (only take high-confidence predictions).
	•	Regime filters (e.g. trade only when volatility < X or volume > Y).

That’s how quants get 50–70% win rates with positive expectancy.

💬 Example Strategy Types That Have Empirical Support

Strategy Type	Typical Hit Rate	Notes
Mean Reversion (pairs/stat arb)	60–70%	Lower returns per trade, higher frequency
Trend Following (momentum)	45–55%	Profitable via big winners
ML-based Directional Models	55–65%	Depends heavily on feature engineering
Volatility Forecasting / Options Selling	55–65%	Risk of tail losses
Sentiment-driven (FinBERT, News ML)	55–60%	Works best on midcap equities / crypto

If you want, I can sketch out a quant roadmap showing:
	•	which data sources to use,
	•	which models to test,
	•	and how to benchmark your predictive accuracy (e.g. directional hit rate, Sharpe, alpha, etc.).
