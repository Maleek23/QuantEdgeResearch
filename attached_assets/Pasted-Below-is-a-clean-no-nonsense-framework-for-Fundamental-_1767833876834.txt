Below is a clean, no-nonsense framework for Fundamental + Technical analysis that actually works across stocks, options, futures, and crypto. This is how professionals structure it — not how it’s taught retail-side.

⸻

FUNDAMENTAL + TECHNICAL

One System. Two Speeds.

Fundamental answers WHAT & WHY
Technical answers WHEN, WHERE & HOW

Neither works alone. Together, they create edge.

⸻

1️⃣ FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS (DIRECTIONAL TRUTH)

Purpose:
Define long-term bias, conviction, and risk justification.

What Fundamentals Do WELL
	•	Identify mispricing
	•	Explain why price should move
	•	Filter low-quality trades
	•	Anchor conviction during volatility

What Fundamentals Do POORLY
	•	Timing
	•	Entries
	•	Risk management

⸻

2️⃣ FUNDAMENTAL INPUTS (BY ASSET)

📈 Stocks
	•	Revenue & earnings trend
	•	Margins & cash flow
	•	Balance sheet strength
	•	Guidance & revisions
	•	Sector & factor exposure

🧠 Options
	•	Upcoming catalysts (earnings, CPI)
	•	Historical vs implied moves
	•	Volatility regime

📊 Futures
	•	Supply / demand imbalance
	•	Macro policy (rates, central banks)
	•	Inventory reports
	•	Seasonality

🔗 Crypto
	•	Liquidity cycles
	•	Network activity
	•	Narrative momentum
	•	Token emissions / unlocks

📌 Output:
➡️ Bullish / Bearish / Neutral bias

⸻

3️⃣ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (EXECUTION TRUTH)

Purpose:
Turn bias into precise trades.

What Technicals Do WELL
	•	Entries & exits
	•	Risk definition
	•	Trade structuring
	•	Timing

What Technicals Do POORLY
	•	Explain why price should move
	•	Predict catalysts

⸻

4️⃣ CORE TECHNICAL COMPONENTS (UNIVERSAL)

Trend
	•	Moving averages
	•	Higher highs / higher lows
	•	Market structure

Momentum
	•	RSI / rate of change
	•	Acceleration vs exhaustion

Volatility
	•	Compression → expansion
	•	ATR, ranges, IV (for options)

Levels
	•	VWAP
	•	Prior highs/lows
	•	Value areas

📌 Output:
➡️ Entry, stop, target, trade structure

⸻

5️⃣ HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER (THE ONLY MODEL THAT MATTERS)

Step-by-Step Logic
	1.	Fundamental Bias
	•	“This asset should go up/down over time”
	2.	Technical Confirmation
	•	Trend aligns with bias
	•	Momentum supports move
	•	Volatility allows favorable R:R
	3.	Execution
	•	Enter at defined level
	•	Stop where thesis breaks
	•	Size based on volatility

⸻

6️⃣ FAILURE MODES (WHY TRADERS LOSE)

Fundamental-Only Traders
	•	Enter too early
	•	Sit through drawdowns
	•	No exits

Technical-Only Traders
	•	Trade noise
	•	Overtrade
	•	No conviction

⸻

7️⃣ PROFESSIONAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	•	Never trade against fundamentals in long timeframes
	•	Never enter without technical invalidation
	•	If fundamentals change → exit
	•	If technicals fail → exit (even if fundamentals stay)

⸻

8️⃣ SIMPLE EXAMPLE

Stock Trade
	•	Fundamentals: earnings revisions ↑
	•	Technical: pullback to VWAP in uptrend
	•	Entry: VWAP
	•	Stop: trend break
	•	Target: prior high

Options Trade
	•	Fundamentals: earnings catalyst
	•	Technical: volatility compression
	•	Structure: defined-risk spread
	•	Exit: post-event volatility collapse

⸻

9️⃣ TL;DR

Layer	Purpose
Fundamental	Direction & conviction
Technical	Timing & execution
Risk	Survival

Fundamentals decide IF.
Technicals decide HOW.

	•	Show options-specific implementations

Just say which.
