r/pennystocks - HI everyone. Lets Discuss best stocks under $10 together-
Hey everyone, This is just a diacussion not a fiancial advice. I want to discuss with all of you best stocks under $10. I'm on the hunt for stocks priced under $10 that you believe have serious potential for significant growth (think 5x or 10x) over the long term. I've been doing my own research and have a list of companies I'm looking at. One in particular that I'm bullish on is POET Technologies (POET).GRAB . NVTS , TUYA . BBAI . I believe in their technology and the potential it has in the photonics and data center space.what are your best stocks?

Yes. They are still in the research and development stage. Many catalysts coming up this year and 2026. Major contracts. Building out a facility in Texas for major production. 1 500k Hyperion unit can potentially produce millions of revenue a year.

This is a 10 year hold honestly.

Sell me on it, this is what I see.

15 expected Hyperion units producing 350 metric tons per year. Estimated revenue of $200,000 per metric ton, gives you $70 million in revenue. 15% net margin brings you to $10.5 million / year in net profit.

$261m market cap means a P/E ratio of ~25. And that won’t be for another 2-3 years at the earliest.

Or am I missing something?

Yeah you fucked a lot of stuff up here, there graphene can sell up to 800k a ton and the lowest is 250k. The net margins are way higher the input cost is almost negligible, maybe for the first year you aren’t wrong with this 10 million$ net estimation. However, that estimation still puts this company at 1$ billion dollar + evaluation. Now consider that they have multiple contracts being released soon that could be as large as the DoD or Tesla (they are involved with the military) + (deal with top 10 automotive manufacturer and building headquarters in Texas). They also have a Nasdaq listing upcoming in Q1 2026 which means they are confident the stock will be higher than 4x its current price by then.

If you are buying this stock now for the short term, the catalysts are the contracts. Simple as that.

Otherwise buy and hold, they are making money printers in the age of nanomaterials. 80k shares long myself (biased)

This is why I asked, instead of assuming and just writing it off. Appreciate the info. Thanks for taking the time to respond.

Any idea on a realistic net margin?

No problem, sorry if I came off obnoxious. 800k is their electronic grade graphene. Realistically I think 45% net margin is very achievable maybe even lowballing after a few years. But it’s just pure speculation at this point. They should constantly be making new Hyperion units to satisfy their incoming demand which will be a large upfront cost but they will pay dividends.

Acetylene is really cheap. Per metric tonne (multiply by 1,000): roughly US$1,210–US$1,700 / tonne of graphene in consumables (acetylene + energy) under the ideal assumptions.

The real cost $$ is the workers needed to run these machines. Hydrograph has some of the most talented material scientists and everyone on their staff so far is well paid. They need more talented workers so Austin will be perfect to hire more talent, but it will also be fairly expensive for the company.

I haven’t really sat down and analyzed all this stuff fully yet but I’m sure when they buy or lease new factories for the units that will be costly also, maybe they can get some loans for that.

You can even round up the acetylene and energy to 2k a tonne and it’s still cheap but they are getting a deal soon to get it straight from the source.

It’s an exothermic reaction so it actually generates syngas as a byproduct which they sell for additional revenue they just need a tiny amount of energy to ignite the electrode to initiate the reaction.

I personally believe that their contracts will be in 1000s+ MT/yr in 2-3 years. The question is going to be management. How quickly and efficiently they can scale up to meet demand.

As far as the PE ratio, 25 is not as bad as PLTR, lol.

My favorites: HGRAF - easily the next big thing being slept on

GRAB - needs to start showing consistent profit and growth. I think it can blow up irrationally like HIMS. Either way, I think a great longterm play. They are imbedding themselves as the go to app for SEA.

ACHR - I buy any dip under $10. The Pivot to the defense industry is where the money will be for them.

PL - renewed contracts. Actually making money.

SLDP - no reason. Just like them over QS as a solid state battery play.

ONDS - drone and wireless tech.. they are securing more contracts and their drones were featured in the latest govt presentation.

AMPX - best small cap battery player currently. No debt, 1B production capacity, 93 customers (they got 43 customers just this quarter), recent Amazon partnership. Had a stellar Q2 earnings.

RZLV - underdog AI stock. They recently secured $70M ARR and expected to reach profitability end of year with $100+ ARR. Currently at $3, with price target of $9. Lot of catalysts coming up

CTM - this is the index fund of small caps for me. Low risk - low reward. Good leadership, though little old school, but they are doing everything right as a good company should. Expect 10%-20% yearly.

BBAI - this is a controversial one. People call it meme stock and hype and what not. I mean do you really care if it makes you money? People shat on PLTR for a long time, and they were against it all the way from $20 to $200 now. I see BBAI doing something similar. I already made upwards of +25k profits from it.

Meme stock is a term used in finance the same ways people use the word conspiracy theory to discredit anyone. BBAI is slowly becoming one of my larger share positions, I’m very hopeful of this over the next 2-3 years. One thing you see common in the MAG 7 8 13 stocks whatever it might be at the time is that they all tend to have solid CEO. BBAI CEO used to be an acting secretary of department of home land security and commission US Customs and border protection. You think that guy might have few relationships in the space they are involved in? Glad to see that someone else sees this company potential

AMPX has everything to become a massive growth stock I’m all in, I also think it’s already a tier above being in the penny stock category.

I like CTM the growth seems more natural and less government dependent.

A lot of people don’t want to admit the black cloud over their RCAT, ONDS, BBAI, even PLTR and that being the midterm elections and the next federal election. If the house goes blue all of these stocks are going to take a decent hit, not devastating but definitely noticeable. However, if the next president is a dem, we’re going to see these PLUMMET, so unless your cash out date is before 2028 I personally wouldn’t touch any of them long term.

I’m sitting on 200 shares of ONDS and already determined that my sale date is next summer to avoid these risks.

Just my two cents

Poet is my big tech investment. 

I somewhat regret not taking profits at $7, and it seems to keep dropping. But it's long term play for me. Hoping for something like $20 -$30.

But, a Truly cheap, long term play would be "first mining gold". They're a gold mine development company in Canada with a couple of good sized assets. Currently trading between 0.15 and 0.20 cents. These guys have been in permitting hell in Canada for 7 years now, but should be coming to the end of that by the end of the year. In the junior mining industry, the granting of permits leads to big raises in shar price so that might be a good target for people here. (A good example of this being generation mining, who more than doubled in price when they got their enviromental permits through). While I don't belive that the Canadian authorities would draw this out for 7 years only to shut it down now, (although I'm British and we do that shit all the time) and Canada IS becoming more pro-mining in this political enviroment (the "oh crap we might have to be somewhat self sufficient" effect), there is a risk due to one deposit being under a lake and therefore the water needs to be diverted. Envirmentalists tend to freak out about that sort of thing.

Meanwhile:

Gold is in a bull market and I don't think many expect it to go down in price in the next few years, more likely to go up. This puts the target price for first mining gold to be somewhere around $5 -$6, but be prepared to hold for 5 years. There aren't many big gold projects in Canada which are at this stage in the development phase and this could truly be one for the record books. Think x30. A rare potential.

 There are easier plays; gold royalty corporation has doubled in price in the last 3 months, currently at $3.25. As a royaly company they have very little overhead and very little risk related to mine operation etc. I dont know how high these guys will go but they seem to have the markets attention and I truly regret not putting more into them then I first invested (recently sold off asml and poured it into these guys.)

They are doing some good work, with results.

Their new testing platform is being released in Texas (where they are based) this month and will be used by several institutions. University of Texas, National Cancer Institute, Texas Oncology to name a few, expanding that footprint over the next year.

I can’t help feeling Adial Pharmaceuticals (ADIL) is on the cusp of big things after the FDA meeting results and manufacturing agreement. I don’t think they would risk diluting at this stage, while things look so promising, so I’m holding and hoping. Biotechs are unpredictable though

Ucore---in the rare earth element space. Only a hair over 2 bucks, recent govt funding, skyrocketing as of late, and has the best separation technology of all which is about to come live at their plant in Louisiana in 2026. When production starts, it should go thru the roof. Do some research--

HGRAF is a company I'm 100% sold on. I truly think it's going to make anyone who's bought in very rich in the next three years or so. Also CVRX, I really believe in the barostim implant. It's having fantastic results, I bought in on the product. I purchased my first shares of both of these companies last week

NuCana (NCNA) – Bull Case Snapshot

Real Oncology Pipeline

NCNA is a legitimate clinical-stage biotech developing ProTide™-based chemotherapies for aggressive cancers such as biliary tract and pancreatic cancer.

Multiple human trials are ongoing, with prior data showing potential for improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to standard treatments.

2. Late-Stage Trial Potential

One of NCNA’s lead drug candidates has been in Phase 3 trials.

Any positive interim data or final readouts could be transformative for the share price.

3. Low Market Cap, High Catalyst Leverage

With a market cap around $9M, the company is priced for uncertainty.

Positive trial results or an FDA fast-track designation could multiply valuation several-fold in days.

4. Low Float After Reverse Split

The recent 1-for-200 reverse split significantly reduced share count.

Low float + major news = the kind of volatility that can lead to explosive moves.

5. Oversold Conditions After Selloff

Heavy selling pressure going into the split has created a deep discount.

If sentiment shifts on even a small piece of good news, the rebound potential is strong.

$META is shocking to me, they are so worthless these days. Failed at Facebook so called themselves Meta. Everyone hates their googles, no good developed apps. Meta Glasses are ok, but literary any of these companies can decide to make smart glasses. Spending hundreds of millions to poach AI talent, but will be years behind OpenAI and Anthropic. Google and Microsoft will still dominate AI enterprise and Apple is only lagging because AI is not relevant to regular consumers yet. 42% of the US reads and writes at a 3rd grade level, most of the country literally cannot prompt well enough, so practical every day use is a few years away. The only shock is that most retirements and pensions are tied to Meta's performances, so its to the best interest of the labor economy that we pretend Meta is worth a $1 per share

I was going to laugh at your 42% illiteracy rate in America… But then I tried reading your run-on paragraph that has a plethora of mistakes in it. So obviously that claim might not be too ludicrous.

OCDO (UK) is currently at £4 ($5). They’re a tech & robotics company that supplies solutions to the grocery industry (warehousing and automated picking/packing) - think Kroger (US), Sobeys (CA) and M&S (UK). They do have high debt, but they’re on the cusp of profitability (2026 should be cash flow positive), and they’re have a strong pipeline of growth in an industry that is also growing fast. Currently shorts (at about 5%) are facing a bit of a squeeze as institutional investors are recognising that now is the time to buy in. I have no idea how many multiples that will increase, but I’m planning to exit at £20/$26 in 5 years. GLDYOR.
