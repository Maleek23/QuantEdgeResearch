QuantEdge Research - Trading Platform
Overview
QuantEdge Research is a dual-engine quantitative trading research platform (AI Analysis + Quantitative Signals) for US equities, options, crypto, and futures markets. Its purpose is to provide educational, research-grade market analysis with robust risk parameters and real-time data, emphasizing strong risk controls and educational disclaimers. The platform focuses on a dark-themed UI for rapid data scanning and is designed for research and educational purposes only, not financial advice. Tagline: "Multiple Engines, One Edge"

User Preferences
All timestamps displayed in America/Chicago (CT) timezone with market session context
Dark/light theme toggle (dark mode is primary)
Educational disclaimers must be emphasized on every screen
Clear risk/reward calculations and position sizing tools
Fresh research briefs highlighted immediately upon opening
Platform functions fully without external AI dependencies (quantitative fallback)
Helpful error messages for API billing, rate limits, and authentication issues
Liquidity warnings for penny stocks and low-float securities
System Architecture
The platform features a React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS frontend (Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, Wouter) and an Express.js, TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) and Drizzle ORM. Authentication uses session-based methods with bcrypt, Replit Auth, and Google OAuth. The system integrates two core engines: an AI Engine (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini) and a Quantitative Engine (RSI(2) Mean Reversion, VWAP Institutional Flow, Volume Spike Early Entry, ADX Regime Filtering).

UI/UX is designed with a "Tech-Minimalist" philosophy, drawing inspiration from institutional trading interfaces. It features a dark-mode-first design, a specific color palette (slate, cyan, green, red, amber, purple, blue), glassmorphism-inspired components, and a clear typography hierarchy using Inter (primary) and JetBrains Mono (data/code).

Core features include public informational pages, user authentication, a main application dashboard, a trade desk with research briefs, a live trading journal, market overview, performance analytics, and various research tools like chart analysis and a historical trade pattern library. The platform includes a Data Intelligence System for historical performance analytics, a Loss Analysis System for automatic post-mortem of failed trades, and a Data Integrity System ensuring consistent statistics across the platform. An Auto-Lotto Bot provides an automated paper trading system with sample size gating for performance metrics. An Educational Blog System offers content on trading skills, while a Real-time Pricing Service consolidates market data from various providers. A Chart Analysis System provides comprehensive technical pattern recognition and support/resistance detection.
