So you just dropped an entire quant platform spec on my desk with no question attached. Bold move. I will assume you want a sanity check and not silent admiration.

Short version first: this is serious work. It is internally coherent, defensible, and far more realistic than 95 percent of retail quant nonsense floating around. Long version below, with the parts that quietly worry me and the parts that are genuinely strong.

What you did right (and most people do not)

1. You actually respect live trading reality
The explicit separation between academic backtests and live performance is excellent. Modeling slippage, spread, execution variance, and time-of-day degradation puts you ahead of most platforms that pretend fills are magic. The 55–65 percent live win rate target is refreshingly honest.

2. Time-of-day restriction is a real edge
Locking signal generation to 9:30–11:30 ET is one of the strongest design choices here. Most systems ignore intraday regime decay. You did not. The diagnostic stats justify it. Good.

3. Triple-filter logic is defensible
RSI(2) + MA regime + ADX ≤25 is a known, research-backed mean reversion setup. You did not invent astrology. You cited Connors, added regime filtering, and constrained conditions. That is how you avoid overfitting.

4. Chart validation as a gate, not decoration
Forcing every trade idea through pattern conflict checks is a big deal. Most platforms bolt chart patterns on as vibes. You are using them as veto power. That is correct engineering discipline.

5. Performance stats split into “filtered” vs “real”
This is unusually responsible. Showing users the cosmetically nice stats and the brutal real stats side-by-side is how you avoid lawsuits and cope posts.

The parts that need tightening before this scales

1. Signal voting logic is inconsistent
You say “require 2+ signals for trade confirmation,” but your code returns early on the first matching priority signal. That means the voting system is mostly theoretical right now.

If priority order is intentional, then remove the voting language. If voting is real, refactor to accumulate and score signals before returning. Right now it reads like a half-finished merge of two designs.

2. VWAP win rate claim is too confident
“80%+ win rate” for VWAP institutional flow will get quoted out of context by users and used against you. Even if internally true for a filtered dataset, externally it reads like marketing optimism.

Suggestion: downgrade the language to “historically high probability under constrained conditions” and let the performance module do the talking.

3. Chart pattern confidence math needs grounding
Pattern confidence values like 70 + (1 - priceDiff) * 20 are fine heuristics, but they are arbitrary. That is not fatal, but if this ever becomes auditable, someone will ask what those numbers mean.

Recommendation: document these as heuristic scores explicitly, not probabilistic confidence. Words matter when regulators sniff around.

4. Exit-time randomization is smart but dangerous
The ±10–30 percent variance is clever for de-correlation, but randomness plus volatility logic plus symbol hash can make debugging brutal.

You may want a debug mode that freezes randomness so trade post-mortems are reproducible. Otherwise you will hate yourself six months from now.

5. Options cost modeling is conservative but still optimistic
A 4 percent round-trip assumption is fine for liquid contracts. It is not fine for lotto strikes, which you explicitly allow exceptions for. At minimum, flag those trades as “cost-unstable” and exclude them from headline stats.

Architectural verdict

This is not a toy. It reads like something built by someone who has actually lost money and learned from it. The strongest signal here is not the indicators, it is the restraint. You limited windows, filtered regimes, capped risk, and documented failure modes.

If this blows up, it will not be because the system was naive. It will be because markets change or users misuse it. That is about as good as it gets in this domain.

If you want next-step feedback, the natural directions are:
	•	Formalizing signal aggregation scoring
	•	Stress-testing regime transitions
	•	Tightening language where marketing and engineering collide

But as it stands, this is solid, sober, and refreshingly un-delusional. I hate how rare that is.
