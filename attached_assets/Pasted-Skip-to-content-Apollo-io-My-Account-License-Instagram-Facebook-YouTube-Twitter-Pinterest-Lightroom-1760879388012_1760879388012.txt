In color grading and video editing, LUTs play a key role. Look-Up Tables are tools all filmmakers and photographers, among others, use to enhance their footage. LUTs come in different formats and can be used in certain scenarios, and as a beginner, we understand you might need some guidance with this.

This guide will teach you everything you need to know about LUT file formats, including when to use each one and the best color-grading LUTs you can add to your collection right away.

What Are LUTs?
LUTs (Look-Up Tables) are mathematical formulas used to map one color space to another. They work similarly to filters, modifying the color and luminance of your footage. You can use LUTs in various software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Photoshop, and many others.

Who Can Use LUTs?
Many people believe that LUTs can only be used by filmmakers or photographers, but in reality, they’re used across multiple industries. 

For example, LUTs are used in the gaming world to help developers create the perfect visual atmosphere for their games. In architecture and real estate, professionals use LUTs to enhance their footage to ensure they look their best. Even in social media marketing, influencers and brands use LUTs to keep a consistent aesthetic across their content.

LUTs are very versatile tools that can be used in any type of footage and project that requires color-grading. In the next sections, we break down the differences between LUT file formats and how you can use them in your workflow.

Common LUT File Formats
There are various LUT file formats, and each has its own set of unique benefits. Let’s take a look at the most common color-grading LUTs file:

.CUBE
The most common LUT format is .cube, which Filmic Pro developed. It is compatible with a wide range of software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.

What’s great about this format is that it supports 3D LUTs, which allow you to conduct a more complex color adjustment. Further, .cube LUTs come in different sizes, representing color precision, and can be fully adjustable (resulting in a finer color gradation).

.3DL
The .3dl format is another popular LUT file format, commonly used by professionals. It was developed by Twixtor and can be used in various software such as Avid Media Composer and Adobe Premiere Pro. 

The .3dl LUT also supports 3D color mapping and can be tweaked as much as you need depending on your color grading needs. The downside of this is that they cannot be applied in a wide range of programs like other LUTs. 

.LUT
The .lut formal is less common than .cube and .3dl but can still be used in many software programs, although they lack some advanced features.

This LUT file format is typically used for simpler color adjustment, rather than complex corrections 3D LUTs offer. 

.AML
Advanced Multilayer LUT, or .aml format, is a new option for color grading with unique features. For example, .aml LUTs support multiple layers of adjustments, which allows you to apply several color-grading effects at the same time. This LUT is used in specialized color grading programs, so is not as compatible as other LUTs. 

Choosing The Right LUT File Format
With different options available, you might be wondering how to choose the right LUT file format for your projects. We recommend you consider the following factors:

-    Compatibility: The number one thing to check for is your LUT file being compatible with your software. If you’re in doubt, check your color-grading program’s information. The go-to file format is .cube thus it can be used in almost every software.

- Color-grading requirements: If you need complex color adjustments, choose a format that supports 3D mapping like .cube or -3dl. For simpler projects, .lut will work just fine.

-       Project requirements: Depending on the project you’re working on, you might need to use more than one LUT file format (check their compatibility with your software).

How to Use LUTs in Your Workflow
Using LUTs can improve your efficiency and make your editing process smoother. If you’re new to LUTs and don’t know how to use them in your workflow, check this easy step-by-step:

Import your LUTs: Depending on your editing software, the way of importing LUTs might vary. Typically, you’ll find an option in the color grading/effects panel to import your LUT files easily.
Apply your LUTs: After you’ve successfully imported your file formats it is time to apply your favorite LUT to the footage in your timeline. 
Adjust settings: Don’t be afraid to play around with your LUTs’ settings. They are a great starting point but the true magic happens when you add your personal touch. 
Create your own LUT: Did you know you can create your own LUT? Just like you can create presets! Once you’re happy with how your footage looks, expert it as a new LUT file to apply it to other projects.
The Best Color-Grading LUTs
As a beginner, you might struggle with finding quality color-grading LUTs, which is why this section will come in handy. Here’s our selection of the best LUTs that can be used in a wide range of projects:

-    Color Pop Video LUT: We love this LUT for enhancing colors and giving your footage a vibrant and unique look.

-      Travel Video LUT: One of our favorite LUTs for achieving a natural and clean look. It is perfect for nature and landscape footage and the result is always a clear, natural video.

-    Golden Video LUT: This LUT is a go-to option for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle content thus it recreates the golden hour with its classic warm, soft orange tint.

Final Words
Understanding the different LUT file formats is key for elevating your color-grading game. There are multiple LUTs you can choose from, which will depend on your needs, software, and type of project. Using LUTs in your workflow will massively improve your editing process and your results.
