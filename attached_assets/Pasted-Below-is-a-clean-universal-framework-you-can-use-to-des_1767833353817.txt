Below is a clean, universal framework you can use to design an Option Engine that also generalizes to shares, futures, crypto, and multi-asset trading. This is written the way a hedge fund engineer + strategist would think about it — not platform-specific, not retail fluff.

I’ll start with the core mental model, then give you a canonical strategy stack that any serious engine must implement.

⸻

🧠 CORE TRUTH (Non-Negotiable)

No strategy works without an edge in ONE of these dimensions:

	1.	Information (faster, better, or cleaner)
	2.	Structure (payoff asymmetry, convexity)
	3.	Timing (entry/exit precision)
	4.	Risk Control (survival > returns)

Every engine — options, shares, futures, crypto — is just a different wrapper around these same mechanics.

⸻

I. UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENTS (All Asset Classes)

These are mandatory primitives your engine needs before any strategy exists.

1️⃣ Market Regime Detection

Before strategy selection.

Regimes
	•	Trending
	•	Mean-reverting
	•	Volatility expansion
	•	Volatility compression
	•	Event-driven

Inputs
	•	Volatility term structure
	•	Trend strength (ADX / slope)
	•	Correlation dispersion
	•	Liquidity conditions

➡️ No regime → no trade

⸻

2️⃣ Edge Identification Layer

Where alpha is detected.

Sources
	•	Price (trend, momentum, mean reversion)
	•	Volatility (IV vs RV)
	•	Flow (institutional activity)
	•	Structure (options skew, term structure)
	•	Information (news, earnings, macro)

This layer is asset-agnostic.

⸻

3️⃣ Risk Unit Definition (R-Unit)

Everything collapses to this.
	•	Max loss per idea (fixed % or volatility-scaled)
	•	Time stop
	•	Price stop
	•	Volatility stop

No exceptions.
No “high conviction overrides”.

⸻

II. OPTIONS ENGINE — FUNDAMENTALS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER

🔑 Options Are About Volatility, Not Direction

Any working options engine must model:

1️⃣ Implied vs Realized Volatility

Core question:

Is volatility cheap or expensive?

Strategies
	•	IV > RV → sell premium
	•	IV < RV → buy convexity

⸻

2️⃣ Greeks That Matter (Not All of Them)

Only these are essential:
	•	Delta → directional exposure
	•	Gamma → convexity / acceleration
	•	Theta → time decay
	•	Vega → volatility exposure

Ignore anything beyond this unless institutional.

⸻

3️⃣ Structural Edge (Payoff Design)

Options win via asymmetry.

Core Structures
	•	Long calls / puts (pure convexity)
	•	Vertical spreads (defined risk)
	•	Calendars / diagonals (time structure)
	•	Strangles / straddles (volatility bets)
	•	Iron condors (volatility suppression)

⸻

4️⃣ When Options FAIL

Your engine must not trade when:
	•	Bid/ask spreads are wide
	•	Liquidity is thin
	•	IV is fairly priced
	•	No catalyst exists

⸻

III. SHARES (EQUITIES) ENGINE — WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS

Shares = linear exposure.

Core Strategies
	1.	Trend following
	2.	Mean reversion
	3.	Breakouts
	4.	Event-driven (earnings, news)
	5.	Factor exposure (momentum, quality)

Key Advantage
	•	Simplicity
	•	Liquidity
	•	Lower friction

Key Risk
	•	No convexity
	•	Requires timing precision

⸻

IV. FUTURES ENGINE — PROFESSIONAL GRADE

Futures = pure macro + leverage.

What Works
	•	Trend following
	•	Carry / roll yield
	•	Volatility breakouts
	•	Session-based behavior

Mandatory Features
	•	Tick value awareness
	•	Contract roll logic
	•	Margin & leverage constraints
	•	Overnight risk modeling

⸻

V. CRYPTO ENGINE — DIFFERENT BEAST

Crypto trades structure, not fundamentals.

What Works
	•	Momentum & breakouts
	•	Funding rate arbitrage
	•	Volatility regimes
	•	Liquidity sweeps

What Fails
	•	Traditional valuation
	•	Long-term mean reversion

⸻

VI. STRATEGY SELECTION MATRIX (THIS IS THE ENGINE)

Regime	Best Instrument	Strategy
Strong Trend	Futures / Shares	Trend following
High Volatility	Options	Long gamma
Low Volatility	Options	Premium selling
Event Risk	Options	Defined-risk spreads
Range-bound	Shares / Options	Mean reversion
Macro Shift	Futures	Breakout

➡️ The engine selects the instrument — not the user.

⸻

VII. RISK MANAGEMENT (THIS IS THE MOAT)

No strategy survives without this.

Must-Have Controls
	•	Max concurrent exposure
	•	Correlation limits
	•	Daily loss limits
	•	Volatility-adjusted sizing
	•	Kill-switch logic

⸻

VIII. WHY MOST ENGINES FAIL

They:
	•	Chase signals without regime context
	•	Ignore volatility structure
	•	Overtrade
	•	Underestimate drawdowns
	•	Don’t track why trades worked

⸻

IX. HOW THIS MAPS TO QUANT EDGE LABS

Your Five Engines already align perfectly:
	•	AI → Information & narrative
	•	Quant → Timing & statistical edge
	•	Flow → Institutional intent
	•	Chart → Structure & pattern
	•	Futures → Macro & leverage

The missing layer is:

Regime → Strategy → Instrument selection logic

That’s your differentiator.

⸻

🔥 TL;DR (Executive Level)

Any engine that works must have:
	1.	Regime detection
	2.	Volatility understanding
	3.	Structural asymmetry
	4.	Strict risk units
	5.	Post-trade learning

Everything else is UI.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Turn this into a formal “Universal Trading Engine Spec”
	•	Design a single meta-strategy selector
	•	Create option-specific widgets
	•	Write a prompt to make Replit build the option engine

Just say which.
