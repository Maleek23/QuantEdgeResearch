Had to do ts on my phone since Im at work but Bull flag breakout on the Daily coinciding with Daily demand gave this the catalyst to explode today. Id like to see how it reacts to the supply level it’s currently in (122.33). If it breaks clean through (closes above 122.33) this should continue to the first PT @ $134. Since it’s such a low cost play, I’d get in whenever, but ideally Id like some type of retracement back down to $116 for another entry, and to not chase PA. 

The 145C has good OI (Open Interest) but the greeks (Delta, Vega and Theta) are lower than I typically get, but this is essentially a lotto so fuck it

Thankfully I had this one charted from a while back, but Ill probably get in this. Can easily see that touching $31. I plan to talk more about stock buying for portfolio building moving forward but I was a buyer around $22, and Im a firm believer in this stock overall, and I love their banking platform.

i wouldnt even touch this, not because its wrong but because its so far OTM. i dont see a point in it

i wont say anything about this. See if you can chart it and let me know. rmb i posted it in my journal too so reference that
Leek — Yesterday at 12:26 PM
Yeah I need to tweak the stuff to be less otm
uzo🃏 — Yesterday at 12:26 PM
i would go a lil more ITM with a $31 or $30call tbh, but i like it. might enter myself honestly. this pullback is prime. closing this 30m candle as ahammer and im in

AMZN: This is kinda a long shot ill be real. It’s in a nice bullish/ascending wedge, but there’s hella supply above this structure. 255 is a way to go (far OTM) for an expiration next week. there’s good OI and volume, and as we know, AMZN can move pretty quick and strong. Im not aware of any catalyst that can impact price. I like the $240 alot more. Alot better volume and OI, closer ITM, and the greeks are much better. A lil more pricey but all up to acc size risk, and I can see the $240 hitting long before the 255
