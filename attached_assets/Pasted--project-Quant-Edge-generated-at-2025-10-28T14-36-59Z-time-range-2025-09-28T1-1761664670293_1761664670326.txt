    "confidence_miscalibration": {
      "issue": "High confidence scores massively overestimate true win probability. Top score bucket 90_100 shows win rate 15.6 pct but expected 90 pct. Low confidence bucket shows better realized win rate.",
      "impact": "Strategy weighting and position sizing are inverted. System will allocate more capital to lower quality trades unless fixed."
    },
    "signal_failures": {
      "issue": "Excellent R R 3 1 plus category has 95 average confidence but only 5 pct win rate. Volume spike early entry has zero wins. Unknown signal type shows inconsistent metrics with extreme avg_return values.",
      "impact": "Signal generation rules are producing false positives and giving them unjustified trust."
    },
    "options_catastrophe": {
      "issue": "Option trades show avg_return near negative 99 which indicates catastrophic losses, bad strike selection or mis recorded pnl.",
      "impact": "Options are dominating negative returns and skewing portfolio metrics."

      "impact": "Backtest and live metrics are unreliable until validation layer is enforced."
    },
    "version_regression": {
      "issue": "Latest engine v3.2.0 shows 0 pct wins while unknown build shows highest win rate. Recent release likely introduced scoring or serialization bug.",
