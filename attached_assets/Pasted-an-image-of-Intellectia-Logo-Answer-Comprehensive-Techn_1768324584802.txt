Comprehensive Technical Analysis for PBR
1. MACD Analysis
The MACD histogram is at 0.0591, above zero, and positively expanding. This indicates bullish momentum is building, suggesting that the stock is in the early stages of a potential upward trend.

2. RSI Analysis
The RSI_6 is at 72.662, which is approaching overbought territory but still in the neutral zone. This suggests that while the stock has seen recent upward momentum, it is not yet overextended, leaving room for further upside before a potential pullback.

3. Moving Averages
The moving averages are converging, indicating a potential shift in trend. Convergence often precedes a breakout or breakdown, and given the other bullish signals (MACD and recent price action), this leans toward a bullish breakout scenario.

4. Price Range Analysis
20-day range: 11.43-12.35
52-week range: 11.03-14.98
The stock is trading near the upper end of its 20-day range and is attempting to break higher. It remains well below its 52-week high, suggesting room for a medium-term recovery if bullish momentum continues.
5. Volume Analysis
The current volume of 11,440,261 is below the 5-day and 20-day averages, indicating reduced participation. However, the price is still rising, which suggests that the current buyers are strong and committed. A volume increase on further price gains would confirm the breakout.

6. Fibonacci Support/Resistance Levels
Pivot: 11.84
Resistance Levels: R1 12.122, R2 12.297, R3 12.579
Support Levels: S1 11.559, S2 11.384, S3 11.102
The stock closed at 12.145, above the pivot level of 11.84 and just above R1 (12.122). This suggests a continuation toward R2 (12.297) and possibly R3 (12.579) in the short term. Downside support is at 11.84 (pivot) and 11.559 (S1).

7. Price Performance
5-day change: +4.97%
20-day change: -0.29%
YTD change: +2.49%
1-year change: -10.17%
The stock has shown strong short-term momentum with a 5-day gain of nearly 5%, recovering from a recent pullback. However, the 1-year performance remains negative, indicating a longer-term downtrend. This suggests the current move is a counter-trend rally within a broader bearish structure.

8. Pivot Analysis
The stock has pulled back -7.85% from its last peak pivot on 2025-11-14, with decreasing volume during the pullback. This indicates the recent decline was corrective rather than impulsive, and the stock may now be resuming its upward trajectory.

Conclusion: Trend Projection
The technical indicators suggest that PBR is in the early stages of a bullish reversal or continuation of its short-term uptrend. The MACD is expanding positively, the RSI is neutral but leaning bullish, and the stock is trading above key pivot levels. The reduced volume is a minor concern but does not negate the bullish signals.
