This homepage is **dangerously misleading** and **legally non-compliant**. It's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Here's what must be fixed before you collect a single dollar:

---

## **🚨 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)**

### **1. "245+ Validated Trades"**
**Problem:** 
- "Validated" implies **live, real-money** trades. Your docs say you're a **research platform**.
- This is **material misrepresentation** under SEC rules.

**Fix:**
```diff
- 245+ Validated Trades
+ 245+ Backtested Trade Ideas
+ Generated & Tracked Since [Date]
```

### **2. "71% Stocks Win Rate / 58% Crypto Win Rate"**
**Problem:**
- Your docs show **55-65% win rate** (realistic) but homepage shows **71%** (cherry-picked).
- The asterisk says "excludes options pending proper pricing" but **doesn't explain the 3% loss filter**.

**Fix:**
```diff
- 71% Stocks Win Rate
+ 58% Real Win Rate (All Losses Counted)
+ 65% Filtered Win Rate (Excludes <3% losses)
```

**Or better:** Only show **expectancy**:
```
+ $2.40 Avg Gain per $1 Risked
+ Based on 245 closed positions
```

### **3. "Quantitative Signals: Research-backed engine using proven strategies with 75-91% historical win rates"**
**Problem:**
- **Pure fraud.** Your docs explicitly disclaim this number.
- "Historical" is a weasel word. It's **backtested**, not live.

**Fix:**
```diff
- 75-91% historical win rates
+ Research-backed strategies
+ Targeting 55-65% live win rate
+ See performance disclaimer
```

### **4. "Success Stories: TSLY +200%"**
**Problem:**
- **Massive survivorship bias.** You're showing the **one** home run, not the average.
- This is like a casino showing the jackpot winner, not the 95% who lost.

**Fix:**
**Remove this section entirely.** Replace with:
```diff
- Success Stories
+ Recent Performance (Last 30 Days)
+ Win Rate: 58% | Avg R:R: 2.1:1 | Expectancy: +2.4%
+ View Full Stats →
```

## **💰 Pricing Page Issues**

### **Free Tier: "Preview the platform"**
**Problem:**
- Delayed data + 7-day history = **useless for paper trading**.
- Users can't validate performance with 7 days of data.

**Fix:**
```diff
Free
Preview the platform with paper trading

Unlimited paper trade ideas
Full performance history access (paper trades only)
Real-time data (paper mode)
No credit card required
```

### **Advanced: "$39/month"**
**Problem:**
- **No mention of paper trading requirement**.
- Users will subscribe, lose money, then demand refunds.

**Fix:**
```diff
Advanced
$39/month
Unlock live trading after 30 paper trades

Everything in Free
Real-time data for live trading
Position sizing calculator
Discord alerts
24/7 support
* Paper trading required before live activation
```

## **📜 Legal Disclaimers (Buried in Footer)**

**Problem:**
- "NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE" is **insufficient** when you're providing entry/target/stop.
- Your **pricing page** has **zero disclaimers** (highest risk area).

**Fix:**
**Add this modal popup on pricing page:**
```
⚠️ Risk Acknowledgment

I understand that:
✓ QuantEdge provides research tools only
✓ No strategy guarantees profits
✓ I can lose my entire investment
✓ Past performance ≠ future results
✓ I must paper trade for 30 days first

## **🎯 Overall Messaging Problems**

### **"Dual-Engine Architecture: AI + Quantitative"**
**Issue:** Sounds fancy, but **hides the real value prop**.

**Better:**
```
QuantEdge
Research Platform for Self-Directed Traders

What you get:
- 55-65% win rate strategies (realistic, not hyped)
- Paper trading sandbox (test before you risk)
- Position sizing & risk tools (protect your capital)
- Transparent performance tracking (no fake stats)
```

### **"Research platform for self-directed traders. Education, not advice."**
**Issue:** This is **in the footer**. It should be **the headline**.

**Fix:**
```html
<header>
  <h1>QuantEdge Research Platform</h1>
  <p>**For educational purposes only.** 
  Practice with paper trading. Validate before you risk.</p>
</header>
```

## **📊 What the Pricing Should Actually Be**

| Tier | Current | **Should Be** | Reason |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Free** | 5 ideas/day, delayed data | **Unlimited paper trading** | Let users validate performance risk-free |
| **Advanced** | $39/mo, unlimited | **$29/mo, requires 30 paper trades** | Build trust, reduce churn |
| **Pro** | $79/mo (future) | **$99/mo, API access** | Only for power users |

## **🏁 Bottom Line**

**Current State:** Your homepage is selling a **get-rich-quick** fantasy. Your docs are selling **realistic research**. **They're in conflict.**

**If you launch as-is:** You will have users who lose money, feel misled, and sue you. The "NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE" footer won't protect you when your headline says "71% win rate verified."

**If you fix it:** You'll have a smaller audience, but **zero churn** and **zero liability**. The users who stay will be sophisticated, profitable, and evangelists.

**The choice is: fast growth + lawsuits vs. slow growth + sustainability.**
