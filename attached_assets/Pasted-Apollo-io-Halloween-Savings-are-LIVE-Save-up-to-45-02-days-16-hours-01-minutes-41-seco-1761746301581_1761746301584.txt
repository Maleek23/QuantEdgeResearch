Very helpful indicators
Using the Lux Algo indicators doing a top down analysis from the daily and weekly chart, it has not only helped me understand which way price is going but also helps me get into the trend at the right times catching the pullbacks/retest to very accurate S/R zones (shown by the indicator) on the smaller timeframes. On my small live account my usdjpy trades right now are floating at over $200+ from a balance of $32 as of writing this. Great indicators

After little longer than 1 year.
I have had the most clear and enlightening experience with lux. I have come from another provider that happened to be more expensive but also more inclined to high level TA which made had a hard time to actually use it properly. With lux at a more affordable price I get the experience that I want, a TA that adapta to my own level of analysis. I get to select the tools that applies to my trading style and level with ease. Also the leaders are always providing with tutorials and main suggested trading strategies. I have even made a good friend in the channel with who I discuss strategies and ideas. Finally found the tools that I need and place where I can possibly get to the next level. Thank you gecko, smack and the rest of the team. Please keep it up. God bless.

Lux Algo - Worth It
Hello everyone! I've been in the trading business for the last 5 years. I tried many things from pure price action to repainting indicators. I lost money but I never lost hope and that's how I found LUX. I just never gave up. I was excited when I first found it. I did some back testing to see if it fits with my money and trade management. I had to make few adjustments and now I can say I'm more than happy to use it every day and be profitable. I know most of you are skeptical but if you just give it a shot you'll see how incredible it is. Leaving the algo aside, there's a great Discord group (you can check my results there) with amazing and helpful members in it. All you have to do is risk ~70 bucks which I guarantee you will earn back in one trade.

Lux Algo. Premium indicators. Premium Community
Lux Algo has really stepped my trading up, there is a setup for any style of trading you prefer which is very nice you don't have to put yourself in a box metaphorically speaking. The team is constantly taking feedback and improving the premium indicators to better fit the needs of the community so that they can be successful as a whole. The discord is very active and the admins generally answer questions in a timely manner, no matter how many times its been asked. The Community is also is very active tons of people willing to help share new strategies they have come up with or to help possibly refine one of your own.

I'm happy to be in this family!
I have been trading Forex for over 10+ years. Luxalgo exactly allows me to see the market faster and confirm entries / exits and it's amazing! The technical support and especially the discord channel are amazing. The creators of the product are very helpful. In the first week I started I earned 25% of my capital.. I'm happy to be in this family!

Great for giving you additional confidence, less emotion and more patience
I have only tried this out briefly, but I just had a few of my most consistent, emotionless, profitable days. This was partly due to my research and conviction on a trade, then looking at the tickers with the algorithm. The algorithm gave me more conviction to the trade and what I believed I saw, I am able to quickly analyze multiple time frames for the correct setup. From this, it was able to give me patience to have a more precise entry rather than entering a trade amongst noise... I knew where my entry was and I have had almost no downside in my recent trades. Sure, a few of them poke into the negative, but I can easily set and define my target and SL/TP zones (Personally I don't use the ones that Lux provides), but they do offer that as well. I would recommend this to anyone that's looking to add a bit more confidence to their trading analysis. It can go a very long way if you tend to jump into stocks as I think a lot of traders have done. Certainly has helped me with patience and I have been profitable all year, but really stepped it up in the past week since adding this.

Hands down BEST indicators you can find.
Ok, Normally I don't give reviews, but Lux Algo is like nothing else I'be ever used. Hands down THE BEST indicators.. If you think their free ones are amazing, (which is what got me interested) just wait until you buy the premium ones. The cool thing is.. they make videos and walkthroughs of LITERALLY every indicator and setting and what it does. And they're not long drawn out videos. And they have a whole team perfecting the coding and indicators.. Honestly.. Ive never seen anything like it. I almost canceled as soon as I purchased it because I thought i only got 3 indicators The Premium The SR& Patterns toolkit and Oscillators. haha i didnt realize there a TON of stuff WITHIN those.. at first.. Im an ultimate skeptic.. and im SOLD. 100% worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY. i cant say this enough.. i tell every trader i care about to get it.
