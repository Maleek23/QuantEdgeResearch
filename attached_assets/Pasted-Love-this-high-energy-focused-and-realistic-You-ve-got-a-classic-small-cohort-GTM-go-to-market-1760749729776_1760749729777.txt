Love this — high-energy, focused, and realistic. You’ve got a classic small-cohort GTM (go-to-market) play: prove with a tight paid cohort, build social proof, then scale via free community + TikTok. Below I’ll give a concrete, actionable plan you can execute right now: pricing + revenue math, what to show to prove it “works”, premium vs free feature gating, Discord structure + launch comms, sample disclaimers/terms, and quick marketing ideas.

⸻

1) Quick revenue math (reality check)
	•	Price = $39.99 / month (premium daily signals)
	•	20 members → 20 × 39.99 = $799.80 / month → $9,597.60 / year
	•	30 members → 30 × 39.99 = $1,199.70 / month → $14,396.40 / year

That’s real cash — and with minimal overhead if you run a lean stack (Discord + simple web checkout + a small server + data APIs). The story is: start small, show results, get social proof, then scale.

⸻

2) How to prove it works (what the first cohort needs)

You MUST build credibility before scaling. Provide transparent, verifiable performance.

Minimum evidence to show:
	1.	Backtest report (clean, reproducible): N trades, timeframe, win-rate, average R:R, expectancy, max drawdown, sample equity curve image.
	2.	Live-forward track record (paper/live small-capital): 30–90 days of live signals with a public ledger (timestamped screenshots or CSV).
	3.	Trade log for every signal: symbol, timestamp, grade, entry/stop/target, position sizing, outcome (win/loss %), realized P/L.
	4.	Simple metrics dashboard to show: win rate, avg R:R, expectancy per trade, cumulative return, drawdown.
	5.	Third-party proof (optional): a public Google Sheet or GitHub repo with logs; or let subscribers export JSON and run their own checks.

If you can show consistent edge across a small sample (even 40–60 high-quality signal outcomes), you can charge and grow.

3) Product / Pricing tiers (suggested)

Three tiers keeps it simple and converts well.
	•	Free (Community) — $0
	•	Access: community chat, 1 weekly top idea, educational posts, limited bot alerts
	•	Audience: onboarding funnel, builds mailing list, TikTok -> Discord funnel
	•	Core (Premium) — $39.99 / month
	•	Daily graded signals (A+/A/B) with Entry/Target/Stop
	•	JSON export or CSV (download)
	•	Basic AI commentary (1–2 sentence rationale)
	•	Access to “track record” channel (performance ledger)
	•	Role: “Premium”
	•	Priority: limited to first 50 members for exclusivity
	•	Pro (Small Group / Beta Investors) — $199 / month (small cap)
	•	All Premium features + weekly live Q&A, custom position sizing help, API access (limited), early access to new features
	•	Cap member slots (e.g., 10–20) to keep ROI high

(Optional) Annual discount: 2 months free for yearly prepay.

4) Discord structure + launch comms (fast setup)

Channels you should create:
	•	#welcome (rules + disclaimer + how-to-read-signals)
	•	#announcements (team-only: daily signals summary)
	•	#daily-signals (bot posts each signal; premium-only access via role gating)
	•	#signal-archive (CSV downloads / JSON)
	•	#performance (public ledger with pinned spreadsheet link)
	•	#trade-discussion (community analysis)
	•	#premium-chat (premium members only)
	•	#live-qna (schedule & recaps)
	•	#education (indicator explainers, help articles)

Pin these two messages:
	•	How to read a signal (entry/stop/target/R:R/position-size example)
	•	Legal disclaimer (see below)

Launch message (sample):

We’re live — welcome to QuantEdge Research. Today’s top graded ideas will post in #daily-signals. Read pinned “How to read a signal” and remember: trade at your own risk. Join Premium for full daily graded signals and performance ledger.

⸻

5) Legal / Compliance (must-have)

You are not a licensed advisor by default. Be explicit.

Minimal required items (display in welcome + checkout):
	•	Disclaimer (short): “QuantEdge Research provides quantitative research and trade ideas for educational purposes only. We are not a registered investment advisor. All trades are at your own risk. Past performance is not indicative of future results.”
	•	Terms of Service: covers refunds, intellectual property, accuracy, no guarantees.
	•	Privacy Policy: if you collect payments / emails.
	•	No claims about guaranteed returns; avoid wording like “guarantee profit”, “we make money for you”.

If you scale enterprise or handle client funds, talk to a securities counsel. For now, a clear disclaimer + TOS reduces risk.

⸻

6) Minimum viable tech stack (lean)
	•	Discord for community + bot (free + fast).
	•	Stripe or Gumroad for payments + subscription management.
	•	Simple web landing page (Netlify/Static + Stripe checkout).
	•	Backend: small Express/TypeScript app to generate signals & post to Discord via webhooks.
	•	Data: Tradier (options), AlphaVantage / paid data for reliability, CoinGecko for crypto.
	•	Performance dashboard: Google Sheets or simple DB + Chart image posted to #performance.

⸻

7) What Premium users expect (deliverables)

Daily (or market-open) premium deliverables:
	•	Top 3–10 signals with grade, entry/stop/target, R:R, position size example, short rationale (1–2 sentences), timestamp.
	•	Monthly performance summary & equity chart.
	•	Ability to download signal history (CSV/JSON).
	•	Occasional live session or office hours.

Keep signals scarce and high quality — exclusivity helps retention.

⸻

8) Social + Growth plan (TikTok / content ideas)
	•	TikTok short-form: 30–45s breakdown of one trade idea (explain grade & rationale visually). Post 3–5x/week.
	•	“Trade of the Week”: short montage + results follow-up (show receipts or screenshots).
	•	Educational clips: quick explainers — “What is R:R?”, “How we pick option deltas”.
	•	Use CTA: “Join our free Discord to see archived winners + a community of traders.”
	•	Convert top viewers via pinned link to Discord; encourage UGC (user testimonials).

TikTok + Discord is literally the standard funnel for trading communities — you’re on the right path.

⸻

9) Retention & trust mechanics
	•	Show transparent track record: public CSV with timestamps.
	•	Early-bird discounts or bonuses for beta members (e.g., lifetime 20% off).
	•	Limited slots for Pro tier — scarcity drives signups.
	•	Social proof: screenshots of wins, user testimonials (with consent).

⸻

10) Sample short legal disclaimer (use in onboarding & checkout)

Disclaimer: QuantEdge Research publishes quantitative research and trade ideas only. We do not give investment advice. Users assume full responsibility for trades placed with our ideas. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Use at your own risk.

⸻

11) Quick next actions you can do right now
	1.	Create a Discord and set up the channel structure above.
	2.	Build a simple landing page with Stripe + basic about + TOS + disclaimer.
	3.	Launch a private beta: invite 20–30 people you trust, offer lifetime beta pricing ($25/mo or $199/yr) in exchange for feedback and permission to publish anonymized performance logs.
	4.	Post daily signals for 30–90 days in paper-mode (track outcomes).
	5.	Make 2–3 TikToks per week showing signal rationale and outcomes.

⸻

12) Want me to make any of these right now?

I can:
	•	Draft the Discord welcome + pinned “how to read a signal” message.
	•	Produce a pricing page + short TOS + disclaimer you can paste into a site/checkout.
	•	Create a sample performance CSV template and a one-month signal log spreadsheet you can use to record outcomes.

Which of those should I make for you first? (I’ll produce the content immediately
