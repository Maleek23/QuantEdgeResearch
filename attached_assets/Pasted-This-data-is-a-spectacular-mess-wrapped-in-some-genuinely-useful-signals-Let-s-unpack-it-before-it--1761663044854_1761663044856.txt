This data is a spectacular mess wrapped in some genuinely useful signals. Let’s unpack it before it collapses under the weight of its own contradictions.

⸻

High-Level Summary
	•	Total trades: 181
	•	Closed: 164
	•	Open: 17
	•	Win rate: 31% (rough)
	•	Profit factor: 19.3 (mathematically suspicious, given negative average returns)
	•	Max drawdown: 4.8K
	•	Average holding time: 18 hours

You’ve got a system that technically survives but doesn’t understand its own confidence or direction. The engine is bragging about high profit factor while racking up high-confidence losses.

Core Problems

1. Confidence System is Delusional
	•	Trades with 90–100 confidence have a win rate of 15.6%, which is catastrophic.
	•	Expected win rate vs. actual: off by −74% on top-tier scores.
	•	Meanwhile, <60 confidence trades have the highest win rate (63%).
Translation: your model’s confidence function is inverted. It’s overfitting to noise or post-optimization bias.

Fix:
You need to retrain or recalibrate confidence scoring using reliability diagrams or isotonic regression. It’s screaming for recalibration.

2. Signal Type Inefficiency

Signal Type	Total Trades	Win Rate	Avg Return	Confidence
Excellent R:R (3:1+)	41	5.1%	-0.54	95
Strong R:R (2:1+)	56	32.7%	0.47	81
Moderate R:R	27	22.2%	-0.69	75
Volume Spike Early Entry	7	0%	0	93
Unknown	50	58.1%	-104.7	12.9

The “Excellent R:R” category is the most embarrassing: 95 confidence, 5% success. It’s labeling suicide missions as golden setups.

Fix:
	•	Re-evaluate the filters generating “Excellent R:R.”
	•	Reduce confidence weighting until you fix calibration.
	•	Possibly merge “Excellent” and “Strong” signals and retrain with contextual filters (ATR, volatility zones, etc.).

3. Asset-Type Breakdown

Asset	Win Rate	Avg Return	Risk:Reward
Stocks	35%	-0.19	2.8
Crypto	28%	+1.86	2.5
Options	26%	-99.3	2.6

Options are tanking the entire portfolio. The average return being negative ninety-nine basically means catastrophic mispricing, bad expiration timing, or overleverage.

Fix:
Quarantine options trades from the dataset until their R:R and strike-delta logic are verified. They’re poisoning the metrics.

4. Time-of-Day Sweet Spots
	•	3 AM ET: 80% win rate
	•	10 AM ET: 75%
	•	2 PM ET: 46%
	•	12 PM ET: utter failure (16%)

Morning performance is strong, afternoon collapses. Either your model misreads volume decay or it ignores market structure shifts after open.

Fix:
Split strategy execution by session. Treat 9:30–11 AM ET as prime time and restrict auto-triggers later unless validated by volume-weighted metrics.

⸻

5. Engine Version Decay
	•	v3.2.0: 0% win rate (just released, possibly uncalibrated).
	•	v2.3.0: 9.5% win rate, better but still weak.
	•	“unknown” builds: doing 38%.

The latest version clearly broke scoring consistency. The “unknown” engine (likely a dev branch) performs best.

Fix:
Audit your scoring pipeline between 2.3.0 and 3.2.0. Something’s off in how probabilities or signal weights are serialized.

⸻

6. Data Integrity Crimes
	•	Trades like “PINS SHORT, target above entry” and “IWM LONG, target below entry” are outright logic failures.
	•	Stop-loss equals entry: fatal oversight (YYAI trade).

Fix:
Add a pre-execution validation layer that checks:

if (is_long and target <= entry) or (is_short and target >= entry) or stop == entry:
    raise TradeValidationError()


⸻

Most Damning Metric

You’ve got 29 trades with 90–100% confidence that lost. That’s statistically impossible unless:
	•	You’re inflating confidence post-signal,
	•	Or the direction labeling flipped somewhere in preprocessing.

It’s the machine equivalent of saying “I’m 100% sure” while walking into a wall.

⸻

Bottom Line
	•	Winning zones: morning hours, stock trades, low-confidence signals
	•	Losing zones: options, “excellent R:R,” and high-confidence signals
	•	Top priority: retrain confidence calibration, patch trade validation logic, isolate options dataset

Once you fix those, I’d rerun a smaller backtest (n=50) to confirm that your expected vs. actual win rates realign.

Would you like me to format this into a JSON-style structured audit summary (for upload into RiskBench or internal dashboards)? It’ll make comparing future runs cleaner.
