Understanding Option Pricing & Timing
Where Does the Entry Premium Come From?
The Entry Premium of $0.23 comes from Tradier API's live market data (the lastPrice field).

This is the actual market price traders are paying for this option contract at the time the trade was generated.

IMPORTANT: Option premium ($0.23) ≠ Stock price (EDIT stock)

The premium is what you pay to BUY the option contract, NOT the stock's current price.

Understanding the Timing Sequence
1
Pattern Identified

Dec 29, 12:45:28 PM CST - When the system identified this pattern

2
Pattern Study Window

Dec 29, 1:23:28 PM CST - Timeframe when pattern is most relevant

Pattern validity window for research purposes

3
Pattern Expiration

Dec 29, 4:28:53 PM CST - When pattern study window closes

For options: based on contract expiry date

Educational Note:

These timeframes show when the pattern was identified and when it expires for tracking purposes.

YOU decide if, when, and how to act on any research. This is not trading advice.
