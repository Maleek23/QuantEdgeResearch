**You are not ready.** Here's the **exact information and evidence** you need to provide to **prove** readiness. Not marketing copy—**proof**.

---

## **"Ready" Means You Can Answer These Questions with Evidence**

### **1. Legal Protection (Non-Negotiable)**

**Question:** *"If a user loses $10,000 and sues you, what happens?"*

**Required Evidence:**
- **LLC Formation Docs**: Show me the EIN confirmation from IRS (PDF)
- **E&O Insurance Quote**: Show me a binder with $1M coverage (screenshot of policy)
- **Securities Attorney Opinion**: Forward me the email where attorney says "You are not an RIA if you do X"

**Without these, you are personally liable.** Your house is on the line.

---

### **2. Paper Trading Enforcement (Technical Proof)**

**Question:** *"Can a new user pay $39 and immediately trade live?"*

**Required Evidence:**
- **Code Screenshot**: Show me the `enforcePaperTrading` middleware in your `server/trade-validation.ts`
- **Error Message Screenshot**: Show me what a user sees when they click "Live Trading" without meeting requirements
- **Database Query**: Show me `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM paper_trades WHERE userId = 'new_user'` (must be ≥20)

**Without this, you're selling car keys to unlicensed drivers.**

---

### **3. Truthful Marketing (Documentation Match)**

**Question:** *"Does your homepage match your actual performance?"*

**Required Evidence:**
- **Homepage Screenshot**: Show me where it says "58% Real Win Rate" (not 64.5%)
- **Performance API Response**: `GET /api/performance/stats` must return `{ winRate: 58, filteredWinRate: 64.5 }`
- **Changelog Commit**: Show me the commit where you removed "75-91%" from all marketing

**If your homepage says 71% but your API says 58%, you're committing fraud.**

---

### **4. Risk Management (Code Proof)**

**Question:** *"What stops a user from taking 5 NVDA trades at once?"*

**Required Evidence:**
- **Correlation Logic**: Show me the function `checkSectorExposure(userId, symbol)` in your codebase
- **Database Constraint**: Show me the error when `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM positions WHERE sector = 'tech' AND userId = X` > 3
- **User Test**: Show me a screenshot of the error message when you try to take 4 tech trades

**Without this, a single sector crash wipes out users.**

---

### **5. User Retention (Real Data)**

**Question:** *"How many users are still active after 30 days?"*

**Required Evidence:**
- **Database Query**: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT userId) FROM trades WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'`
- **Cohort Analysis**: Show me a chart of Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention for your last 10 signups
- **Refund Rate**: Show me Stripe dashboard (must be <5%)

**If users churn in 7 days, your product is broken, not your marketing.**
