========================================
Replit has ALL 10 environment variables. When you run in VSCode, the startup check will now show you exactly what's missing!

Here's exactly what you need to do in VSCode:

Pull the latest code (includes the startup check + .env.example)

Create a .env file in your project root:

cp .env.example .env
Copy secrets from Replit to your .env file:
Go to Replit → Tools → Secrets
Copy each value to your .env file
The most critical ones are:

DATABASE_URL - Without this, no trade ideas load = null values = crash
TRADIER_API_KEY - Without this, no stock prices = null = crash
SESSION_SECRET - Without this, auth breaks
Run the server - The startup check will now tell you exactly what's missing
The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')" happens because without TRADIER_API_KEY, stock prices return null, and the UI tries to format null.toFixed(2) which crashes. oull from replit
Bash Pull latest from Replit with startup check
IN
git pull origin main

You have 49 env variables! Let me check if the critical ones have valid values:

Bash Check if critical env vars have values
IN
grep -E "^(TRADIER_API_KEY|DATABASE_URL|SESSION_SECRET)=" .env | while read line; do
  key=$(echo "$line" | cut -d'=' -f1)
  val=$(echo "$line" | cut -d'=' -f2-)
  if [ -z "$val" ] || [ "$val" = '""' ] || [ "$val" = "''" ]; then
    echo "$key = EMPTY ❌"
  else
    echo "$key = SET (${#val} chars) ✓"
  fi
done

OUT
DATABASE_URL = SET (118 chars) ✓
SESSION_SECRET = SET (88 chars) ✓
TRADIER_API_KEY = SET (28 chars) ✓
All critical vars are set! Let me run the server and see the startup check:

Bash Start server and capture startup output
IN
timeout 15 npm run dev 2>&1 | head -60

OUT
(eval):1: command not found: timeout
Bash Start server briefly to see startup output
IN
npm run dev 2>&1 &

I see the issue in the logs! Look at these lines:

Some stock prices are returning undefined from the API. This is likely happening because the market is closed and some price sources aren't returning data.

The server is running. Now open your browser and let me know if the error happens. If it does, also check if you see those undefined prices in the UI.

The fixes we made should handle undefined values, but if the error still occurs, we need to check if the API endpoints themselves need protection.
