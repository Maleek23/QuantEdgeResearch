Descending Triangle
Technical Analysis
The chart for MARA on the 5-minute timeframe shows a significant preceding downtrend, followed by a consolidation phase forming a Descending Triangle pattern. This pattern is characterized by a clear horizontal support level and a declining resistance trendline. The horizontal support is well-established around 2.06, indicated by multiple price touches. The declining resistance trendline connects the high point after the initial drop (approximately 2.38) with the current price action, which is presently testing this trendline around 2.22. The price is pressing against this key resistance level, indicating a potential attempt by buyers to reverse the short-term trend. For an immediate trade setup, we are looking at a potential **bullish breakout** from this Descending Triangle. While a descending triangle typically resolves bearishly, the current price action challenging the upper trendline presents an opportunity for a reversal or strong bounce if successful. **Trade Setup Details:** * **Entry Point**: A conservative entry is set at 2.24, requiring a clear break and sustained close above the declining resistance trendline to confirm the bullish momentum. * **Target Price**: The target is calculated by projecting the height of the triangle from its widest point (approx. 2.38 high to 2.06 support, a difference of 0.32) upwards from the breakout point. This results in a target of 2.24 + 0.32 = 2.56. This target aligns closely with a previous resistance level (dashed line) around 2.60, adding confluence. * **Stop Loss**: A stop loss is placed at 2.19, just below the recent swing low and the declining trendline, to manage risk effectively in case of a false breakout or a reversal downwards. **Sentiment**: The overall immediate sentiment is **bullish**, anticipating a successful breakout above the descending resistance. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the preceding bearish trend and the typical bearish implications of a descending triangle if it were to break downwards through support.
