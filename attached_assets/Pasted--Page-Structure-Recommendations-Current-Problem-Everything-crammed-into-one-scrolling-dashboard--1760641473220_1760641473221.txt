📄 Page Structure Recommendations
Current Problem: Everything crammed into one scrolling dashboard - can't deep link, hard to navigate

Recommended Pages:

Home Dashboard - KPIs, recent ideas, quick actions
/trade-ideas - Full filtering, history, performance tracking
/market - Live prices, charts, symbol search
/watchlist - Alerts, quant analysis, price targets
/risk - Position sizing calculator, R:R visualization
/bot - QuantAI full-page chat interface
/about - Already exists ✅
/settings - Preferences, notifications, API keys
🧭 Navigation Improvements Needed
Current: Single page with anchor links, no back button
Recommended:

Grouped sidebar: Research (Market, Trade Ideas) | Tools (Risk, Watchlist) | Automation (Bot)
Breadcrumb navigation: Home > Trade Ideas > AAPL Option
Back button in headers for task switching
Persistent search bar in top utility bar
🎨 UI/UX Critical Fixes
Information Overload: Nested accordions hide state - use progressive disclosure cards
Quick Actions: Convert dialog → persistent right drawer
Mobile: Add breakpoints - tables become stacked cards <1024px
Feedback: Loading skeletons per section, data freshness badges
Filters: Move to collapsible toolbar (currently hidden in dropdowns)
🤖 Path to 99% Accuracy (Post Real-Data Integration)
Phase 1 (Current):

Real historical data ← IN PROGRESS
Accuracy: 75-85% (from current 40-60%)
Phase 2 (Short-term):

Backtesting system with labeled outcomes
Precision/Recall metrics per asset class
Accuracy: 85-90%
Phase 3 (Medium-term):

Add ATR, realized volatility, order flow features
Ensemble consensus + abstain policy (only show high-confidence)
Accuracy: 90-95%
Phase 4 (Long-term - ML Required):

Historical warehouse (DuckDB/Parquet) with 3-5 years OHLCV
Gradient boosted trees / Temporal Fusion Transformer
Walk-forward validation, calibrated probabilities
Accuracy: 95-99% on high-confidence predictions
CRITICAL: 99% is achievable ONLY with abstain policy - model shows predictions when confident, otherwise defers to human judgment.

Let me continue implementing the real historical data fix - this is the #1 blocker for accuracy!
