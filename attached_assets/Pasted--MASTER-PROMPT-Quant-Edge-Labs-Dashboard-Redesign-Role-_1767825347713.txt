🔥 MASTER PROMPT — Quant Edge Labs Dashboard Redesign

Role & Mindset

You are a principal quantitative engineer / hedge fund technologist with 30–40 years of experience, collaborating with:
	•	a senior UI/UX designer (financial dashboards, Bloomberg-level clarity)
	•	a statistician (signal validation, confidence calibration)
	•	a senior software engineer (scalable front-end + data pipelines)

You think in signal quality, decision velocity, cognitive load, and risk-adjusted outcomes.

⸻

🎯 Objective

Redesign and extend the existing Quant Edge Labs dashboard into a professional, institutional-grade research command center with 20–30 modular widgets, while building on top of the current architecture and components.

Do NOT rewrite the app from scratch.
Refactor, extend, and enhance what already exists.

⸻

🧠 Core Design Philosophy
	•	Optimize for signal conviction, not visual noise
	•	Every widget must answer one of:
	•	Is this trade worth taking?
	•	Why or why not?
	•	What is changing right now?
	•	UI should feel like:
	•	Bloomberg Terminal × Notion × modern SaaS
	•	Fast scanning → deep drill-down
	•	Designed for self-directed traders, not beginners

⸻

🧩 Dashboard Structure (Required)

Design the dashboard as modular, resizable widgets with saved layouts.

Top-Level Zones
	1.	Global Market Context
	2.	Active Signal Intelligence
	3.	Engine-Level Diagnostics
	4.	Risk & Performance
	5.	Execution & Experimentation

⸻

📊 REQUIRED WIDGETS (20–30 TOTAL)

1️⃣ Market Overview (5–6 widgets)
	•	Market Regime Detector (Risk-On / Risk-Off / Neutral)
	•	Volatility Snapshot (VIX, VVIX, realized vs implied)
	•	Index Heatmap (SPX, NQ, RTY, BTC, ETH)
	•	Futures Bias Panel (NQ, GC – trend, levels, tick bias)
	•	Economic Calendar Impact Meter
	•	Correlation Matrix (assets vs indices)

⸻

2️⃣ Signal & Idea Intelligence (6–8 widgets)
	•	Live Research Brief Feed (sortable by conviction)
	•	Signal Confidence Score (0–100 composite)
	•	Multi-Engine Convergence Gauge (visual overlap)
	•	AI Consensus Summary (bullish / bearish / mixed)
	•	Time-to-Invalidation Countdown
	•	Idea Lifecycle Tracker (new → active → resolved)
	•	Win Probability vs R:R Scatter Plot

⸻

3️⃣ Engine Diagnostics (5–6 widgets)
	•	AI Engine Status (sources, agreement %, sentiment drift)
	•	Quant Engine Panel (RSI(2), VWAP distance, z-scores)
	•	Flow Scanner Tape (sweeps, blocks, dark pool)
	•	Chart Pattern Detector (with thumbnail previews)
	•	Futures Engine Levels (CME ticks, targets, invalidation)

⸻

4️⃣ Risk & Performance (5–6 widgets)
	•	Rolling Win Rate (7d / 30d / all-time)
	•	Confidence Calibration Curve
	•	Symbol Leaderboard (best / worst)
	•	Drawdown Heatmap
	•	Loss Pattern Clustering (auto-tagged)
	•	Strategy Attribution (which engine contributed)

⸻

5️⃣ Trading & Experimentation (4–5 widgets)
	•	Paper Portfolio Overview
	•	Auto-Lotto Bot Activity Monitor
	•	Live R:R Opportunity Scanner
	•	Backtest Preview Panel (Pro-ready)
	•	Alerts & Notifications Center

⸻

🎨 UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
	•	Dark-mode first (quant-friendly contrast)
	•	Dense but readable (no wasted space)
	•	Color used only for meaning (risk, confidence, delta)
	•	Hover = explanation, never clutter
	•	Click = drill-down, not navigation hell
	•	Mobile responsive only for monitoring, not analysis

⸻

🛠 Engineering Constraints
	•	Reuse existing components where possible
	•	Abstract widgets into reusable modules
	•	Prepare for:
	•	WebSockets / real-time data
	•	Feature flags (Free / Advanced / Pro)
	•	Future API & backtesting integration
	•	Keep performance top-tier (lazy loading, memoization)

⸻

📦 Deliverables
	1.	Redesigned dashboard layout
	2.	Widget architecture & naming
	3.	UI component structure
	4.	Data flow explanation (high-level)
	5.	Any refactors required to support scale
	6.	Clear TODOs for Pro-tier expansion

⸻

⚠️ Hard Rules
	•	Do NOT simplify for beginners
	•	Do NOT remove existing functionality
	•	Do NOT treat this as a marketing page
	•	This is a decision-support system, not a charting toy

⸻

Build like this will be used by professional traders managing real risk.
