Analyze the Chart
Match your timeframe to your expiration date

Which Timeframe for Which Expiry?
This is the most important concept. Your chart timeframe should match your trade duration:

5-15 Minute
Same-day (0DTE)
Quick momentum plays that resolve in hours
1 Hour
1-3 day swings
Catching overnight moves or 2-day momentum
4 Hour
Weekly options (5-7 days)
Best for Friday expirations bought Mon-Wed
Daily
2-4 week swings
Monthly options or longer-dated plays
For Weekly Options (Expiring Friday)
Primary
4-Hour Chart
Shows the weekly trend and key support/resistance levels

Entry
1-Hour Chart
Fine-tune your entry point within the larger trend

Confirmation
Daily Chart
Make sure you're trading WITH the larger trend

Bullish Signs

Higher highs and higher lows
Bouncing off support levels
RSI below 30 (oversold bounce)
Volume increasing on up moves
Bearish Signs
Price below key moving averages
Lower highs and lower lows
Rejecting at resistance levels
RSI above 70 (overbought fade)
Volume increasing on down moves
3
Pick Your Strike & Expiry
Balance probability vs. reward potential

Strike Price Selection
ITM
In-The-Money
Delta 0.60-0.80
Higher cost, higher probability. Best for directional conviction plays.

ATM
At-The-Money
Delta ~0.50
Balanced risk/reward. Good for uncertain direction but expecting a move.

OTM
Out-of-The-Money
Delta 0.20-0.40
Cheaper, higher reward but lower probability. Use for lotto plays only.

Expiration Selection Rules
Give yourself 2x the time you think you need
Weekly plays: Buy Monday-Wednesday for Friday expiry
Avoid buying options expiring in less than 3 days
Theta decay accelerates rapidly in final 5 days
Risk/Reward Quick Guide
