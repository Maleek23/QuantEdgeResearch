vibe coding is the ultimate cheat code because it allows you to build complex software just by explaining your logic to a computer. you do not need a degree in computer science to do this anymore because the ai handles the syntax while you handle the strategy. the most important part is having a framework so you do not just wander aimlessly into the markets with a random script

the rbi system stands for research backtest and implement which is the golden rule for any algorithmic trader who wants to keep their money. you start by researching an edge then you backtest it to see if it actually works and finally you implement the live bot once you have the data to back it up. skipping any of these steps is basically just gambling with extra steps
markets are not just one big soup of price action because they move in specific regimes like trending or mean reverting. successful traders focus on these regimes to stay profitable and you should do the same by identifying which environment you are in right now. focusing on trending bull markets for a breakout strategy is often where the easiest money is made
a breakout strategy is simple enough for anyone to understand because it just waits for the price to break a previous high. we look for the highest price over the last twenty days which we call the daily resistance level. when an hourly candle closes above that level it confirms that the momentum is real and it is time to enter a trade
python is the language of the markets and it is surprisingly easy to set up once you have vs code on your machine. you use libraries like pandas for data and backtesting dot py to run your simulations without needing to write everything from scratch. this allows you to focus on the math and the logic instead of worrying about how the code actually works under the hood

backtesting is where dreams go to die or where they are validated because the data does not lie. you take historical price data and run your breakout logic through it to see how many times you would have won or lost. if your strategy can not make money on past data it is almost certainly not going to make money in the live market

survivorship bias is a huge trap where traders only test their bots on coins that have already pumped ten times. this gives you a fake sense of security because any strategy looks good on a winning coin. you need to test your logic on a variety of symbols to ensure it is robust and can handle different types of price action
once you are confident in the backtest you move into the implementation phase where the bot actually talks to the exchange. the bot runs in a continuous loop which means it never sleeps and is always looking for the next breakout. it scans all available pairs on an exchange like hyperliquid and checks them against your resistance criteria every few minutes
the scanner is the heart of the bot because it does all the heavy lifting of looking through hundreds of coins for you. it pulls the latest price data and calculates the resistance levels in real time for every symbol on the list. if a symbol meets the criteria the bot triggers the trade immediately without any human hesitation
Image
execution is everything because you need to have a hard stop loss and a take profit to protect your capital. for a breakout bot a three percent take profit and an eighteen percent stop loss can be a solid starting point for maximizing gains while surviving volatility. the bot handles these orders automatically so you do not have to sit there staring at the screen all night
it is vital to have logic that checks if you are already in a trade before opening a new one to avoid doubling down on the same move. the bot should check your current positions and only open a new trade if that specific symbol is not already active. this keeps your risk consistent and prevents the bot from filling your account with redundant trades
Image
you also need to manage your open orders by canceling any old ones before placing new entries. if the price moves away from your entry point you do not want an old limit order sitting there waiting to be filled when the setup is no longer valid. keeping a clean state ensures that the bot only executes when the conditions are perfect
optimization is the process of tweaking your parameters like the lookback period or the exit percentages to find the best performance. you can run hundreds of different combinations in your backtester to see which settings would have yielded the highest return with the lowest drawdown. this gives you a mathematical edge rather than just guessing what might work
most people fail at trading because they let their emotions take over when the market gets volatile. a bot does not feel fear or greed and it will perfectly execute the plan you researched and tested. by moving to an automated system you are effectively removing the weakest link in the trading process which is the human brain

switching from manual trading to vibe coding is the best way to remove emotions from your financial decisions. it takes time to learn the rbi process but once you have it you are no longer a retail gambler. you are a systematic trader who uses code and data to navigate the markets with confidence and precision
remember, start with the R - research, then start B - backtesting, then vibe code your bot in I - implementation. the markets aren't going anywhere, you have unlimited time.
