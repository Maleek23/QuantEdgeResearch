7 Ideas
RENDER
85% Conf.
Entry: $2.24
Target: $2.576
Render momentum: +13.2% 24h

SUI
85% Conf.
Entry: $1.96
Target: $2.254
Sui momentum: +13.3% 24h

DNN
55% Conf.
Entry: $1.7
Target: $1.82
Growing global emphasis on nuclear energy as a clean and reliable power source, which could drive increased uranium demand and higher spot prices. Sector-specific policy tailwinds are strong.

BBAI
55% Conf.
Entry: $3.5
Target: $3.75
Renewed speculative interest in AI penny stocks and potential for new contract announcements, particularly in defense or government AI applications. General AI sector momentum could spill over into smaller caps.

MARA
55% Conf.
Entry: $19
Target: $20.4
Strong positive correlation with Bitcoin price action; sustained BTC rally above $95,000 could lead to an amplified move in MARA. Potential for a short squeeze given high short interest.

SOL
50% Conf.
Entry: $137.1
Target: $143.95
Solana's ecosystem continues to expand with strong developer activity and DeFi/NFT growth. A stable Bitcoin price could trigger a rotation into high-growth L1 altcoins like SOL.
