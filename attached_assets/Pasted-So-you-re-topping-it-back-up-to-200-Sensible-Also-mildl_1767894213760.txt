So you’re topping it back up to $200. Sensible. Also mildly annoying because now I have to help you not torch it again.

We’re going to pretend that $200 is fragile glass, not casino chips. The goal is to get traction without blowing up. Read this like it’s law, not vibes.

⸻

THE $200 OPTIONS PLAYBOOK (STRICT)

1. Non-negotiable account rules
	•	Account size: $200
	•	1 contract max per trade
	•	Max risk per trade: $25–$35
	•	Max loss per trade: 20% of contract
	•	Max trades per day: 1
	•	Max red days in a row: 2, then you stop trading for 2 full days

If you break any of these, stop trading. Not later. Immediately.

⸻

2. What you are ALLOWED to trade

You do not get creative here.

Tickers only:

SPY, QQQ, AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, SOFI, HOOD

That’s it. Liquid, tight spreads, predictable behavior.

Expiration rules:
	•	Minimum: 10–21 DTE
	•	No same-week expiration
	•	No SPXW
	•	No “expires tomorrow but looks cheap” nonsense

Strike rules:
	•	ATM or one strike ITM
	•	If delta is below ~0.35, you’re gambling. Don’t.

⸻

3. Your ONLY two setups

You don’t get a “bag of tricks.” You get two.

Setup A: Trend continuation (your bread and butter)

Conditions:
	•	Price above VWAP for calls, below VWAP for puts
	•	Clear higher highs / higher lows or vice versa
	•	Entry on pullback, not breakout

Execution:
	•	Buy 1 contract
	•	Target: +20–25%
	•	Stop: -15–20%

You take profits fast. You don’t hold for ego.

⸻

Setup B: Reversal at key level

Conditions:
	•	Major support or resistance
	•	Rejection candle
	•	Volume confirmation

Same exits. Same size. No exceptions.

If you can’t explain the setup in one sentence, you don’t take it.

⸻

4. What you do on slow days

This is where accounts die.

On slow days:
	•	You do not trade
	•	You mark levels
	•	You wait for power hour only
	•	You do nothing else

Boredom is cheaper than losses.

⸻

5. Growth expectations (be serious)

You are NOT trying to double the account weekly.

Realistic path:
	•	$200 → $260
	•	$260 → $350
	•	$350 → $500
	•	$500 → $750
	•	$750 → $1k+

Each step unlocks more size. Until then, stay small.

6. How Quant Edge fits in (properly)

Quant Edge is not a green light. It’s a filter.

You use it to:
	•	Confirm trend strength
	•	Avoid chop
	•	Stay out of overextended trash

You do not use it to convince yourself a bad trade is “high probability.”

⸻

Final truth, no sugar

You didn’t lose money because you started with $120.
You lost money because you traded like the market owed you speed.

If you follow this exactly for 30 trading days, you’ll still be here. That alone puts you ahead of most people.

Next, if you want, I can:
	•	Build you a one-page daily checklist
	•	Tell you exact strikes + DTE to look at each morning
	•	Set rules for when to scale once you hit $300

But none of that matters if you break rules on boring days.
