Design a Bold, Trust-First Quantitative Trading Platform with Immersive Data Visualization & Transparency-Driven UX"

Prompt Body:
You are a senior product designer tasked with redesigning QuantEdge, a dual-engine quantitative trading research platform that combines AI analysis with technical signals. The goal is to transform complex trading data into an intuitive, visually striking experience that builds trust through radical transparency while maintaining professional credibility.
The platform serves both novice traders seeking education and experienced traders wanting data-driven insights. The design must balance sophistication with accessibility.

🎯 Brand Concept

Secondary: Finance enthusiasts, data analysts, quantitative researchers
Psychographics: Value transparency, distrust "black box" systems, want to learn not just follow

Brand Values: Transparency, education, data integrity, continuous improvement, community-driven
Visual Identity:

Primary Colors: Deep navy/charcoal (trust, stability) + electric cyan/teal (data, precision)
Accent Colors: Success green, warning amber, danger red (signal states)
Supporting Palette: Subtle purple/violet (AI engine), steel blue (quant engine)

Community-Centric: Discord integration isn't just auth—it's the heart of the platform
Performance Obsessed: Fast loading, real-time updates, no lag on data refreshes
Mobile-First Analytics: Complex data must work beautifully on small screens


🚀 Success Metrics to Design For

Conversion: Free → Discord member (high priority CTA placement)
Engagement: Time spent exploring signal breakdowns (make them visually engaging)
Trust: Repeat visits to performance ledger (make it bookmarkable, shareable)
Education: Completion rate of "How It Works" resources (make them interactive, not boring)
Retention: Discord activity (integrate Discord presence into platform UI)
