Technical Analysis
The S&P 500 (SPY) chart, displayed on a WEEKLY timeframe, shows a significant uptrend from May '25 to Jan '26, bringing the price from approximately $475 to over $680. Currently, the price is consolidating in a range labeled 'Q4 - Q1' (Nov '25 - Mar '26) between roughly $675 and $690. This consolidation occurs at the peak of a strong rally, often signaling potential trend exhaustion. The price recently challenged the upper boundary of this consolidation around $690-$691, with the latest price shown as $690.02 (which is consistent with the provided live price of $690.38). The yellow arrow indicates a projected scenario where the price attempts to break out above the $690 resistance but fails, leading to a strong reversal and a move downward. This suggests a potential 'Double Top' pattern or a strong rejection from a significant resistance zone after a failed breakout attempt. A short position is favored upon confirmation of this rejection. Key resistance is identified between $680 and $690, with an immediate overhead resistance at the recent high around $692.00. Immediate support is at the bottom of the current consolidation zone around $675.00. A more significant support level, also targeted by the yellow arrow, is at $650.00, which acted as a previous resistance point and psychological level.
