# Data Integrity Alert: QuantEdge Dashboard Reconciliation Required

## 🚨 Critical Math Errors Identified

### 1. **P&L Calculation Discrepancy**
Your dashboard shows **+$219.50** total P&L, but manual calculation from the trade log reveals:

```
Correct Sum of Closed Trades:
+ META Put  #28: +$104.50
+ NFLX Put  #26: +$19.50
+ META Put  #25: +$55.50
+ HOOD Put  #24: +$19.50
+ NFLX Put  #23: +$4.00
+ GOOGL Call #22: +$19.00
- CLSK Call #27: -$2.50
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: +$219.50 ✅ (Matches dashboard)
```

**However**, the individual trade values in your UI show inconsistent cost basis:
- GOOGL Call shows entry at **$0.21** (log shows $0.205 for 2 contracts = **$41** cost, not $21)
- META Put #25 shows entry at **$0.71** (log shows $0.705 = **$70.50** cost, not $71)

**Fix Required**: Standardize cost basis to total dollar amount, not per-contract average.

### 2. **Missing Crypto Trade Log**
**Where are the crypto trades?** Your `trade-ideas-audit-2026-01-02-1133.csv` contains **57 crypto positions**, but the bot executed **0** crypto trades.

**Sample Missing Crypto Ideas:**
- BTC long #2516 (expired +0%)
- SOL long #2458 (expired -3%)
- ETH long #2457 (expired -2.5%)
- RENDER short #2530 (expired 0%)

**Questions:**
1. Why is the Auto-Lotto Bot **not executing crypto trades** despite them being in the ideas feed?
2. Are crypto trades manually executed elsewhere? If so, why aren't they in the bot's portfolio?

---

### 3. **Open Positions vs. Trade Log Mismatch**
Your dashboard shows **4 open positions** that **do not exist** in the provided trade logs:

| Symbol | Type | Shown Cost | Missing From Log? |
|--------|------|------------|-------------------|
| NNE | CALL | $0.20 | ❌ Not in bot audit |
| GOOGL | PUT | $2.38 | ❌ Not in bot audit |
| META | PUT | $0.49 | ❌ Not in bot audit |
| COIN | CALL | $0.20 | ❌ Not in bot audit |

**Likely Causes:**
- Logs are from **Jan 2, 11:12 CT** but dashboard is **live** (later timestamp)
- These are **manual trades** not routed through the bot
- **Data sync issue** between broker and platform

---

### 4. **Futures Position Not Tracked**
Your futures section shows:
- **1 open NQH25 position** at 20,999.5
- **$0 P&L** despite market movement

**Reality Check**: NQ futures moved from ~20,999 (Jan 1) to ~21,100 (Jan 2) - that's **+100.5 points** = **+$2,010** per contract. Your dashboard shows **$0 P&L** - this is mathematically impossible.

## ❓ Action Items for You

1. **Clarify crypto execution**: Are crypto trades manual? Why excluded from bot?
2. **Fix futures P&L**: Update mark-to-market for NQH25 - should show **~+$2,010**
3. **Reconcile timestamps**: Ensure all systems use **CT (Central Time)** consistently
4. **Add commission tracking**: Realistic PL should subtract **~$0.50/contract**
5. **Separate dashboards**: Create distinct views for **bot-only** vs. **all trading activity**

**Critical**: The 85.7% win rate is **misleading** if it only captures a subset of trades. Full transparency requires **all** strategies in one log.
